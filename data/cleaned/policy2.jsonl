{"page": 7, "text": "Introduction to PM Ayushman Bharat Health\nInfrastructure Mission\n1.1 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n\n1.1.1. The COVID 19 pandemic has highlighted the fact that essential public health functions\nnecessary to respond to such an outbreak were weak. Limited laboratory capacity at\nall levels meant that functions of testing, case detection, surveillance and outbreak\nmanagement were challenging and facilities for critical care provision lacked adequate\nIntensive Care Units, Isolation Beds, Oxygen supply, and Ventilators. COVID 19 also\nillustrated that despite using the health systems approach to horizontal integration\nbetween programmes, much more needs to be done to strengthen convergence between\ninstitutions created for vertical disease control programmes and the district and sub district\nservice delivery systems.\n\n1.1.2. In the early months of the pandemic, particularly in states with weak health systems there\nwas a significant decline in the delivery of non-COVID essential services, on account of\nmarshalling of all resources for COVID related activities. Health systems across the country\nwere hard put to manage the delivery of both sets of services, viz. the COVID and non-\nCOVID essential health services.\n\n1.1.3. Public health has significant externalities (food and drug regulation/, public health action,\nincluding health promotion and prevention and surveillance for infectious disease) which\nrequire government intervention. Persistent inequities in access and coverage are a barrier\nto India’s progress in health indicators and markets do not address inequities in health care.\n\n1.1.4. The on-going COVID 19 pandemic has demonstrated that India’s health systems need to\nbe better equipped to address public health needs across primary, secondary, and tertiary\ncare levels. India’s current epidemiological and demographic status, with the rapid rise\nin non- communicable diseases, a double burden of chronic and infectious diseases, and\nunfinished agenda of reproductive, maternal new-born and child health services has created\nan increasing demand on health care and public health services.\n\n1.1.5. At the same time, high costs of care, persistent health inequalities, and reduced access to\nessential public health services particularly for those living in remote areas and in slum and\nslum like areas, challenge our health system. COVID 19 and predecessor Infectious diseases\nsuch as SARS, H1N1, NIPAH and Zika outbreaks have highlighted that the health systems\nneeds to fully prepare and gear up to respond to public health emergencies."}
{"page": 8, "text": "Operational Guidelines for PM Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission\n\n1.1.6. 27.5% of all deaths in India in 2016 were due to communicable diseases, maternal, neonatal\nand nutritional disorders while non-communicable diseases and injuries accounted for\n61.8% and 10.7% deaths respectively. Communicable diseases also contribute to 32.7% of\nDALYs in India (Source: India: Health of the Nation’s States, ICMR) whereas injuries contribute\nto 11.9% of DALYs in India, and 10.7% of deaths in India. It is anticipated that about 3-5% of\nemergencies would require ICU facilities and oxygen supported beds for critical care. There is\nan urgent need to strengthen these facilities and create additional amenities (infrastructure,\nequipment etc.) including for dialysis, in existing district hospitals to meet such unforeseen\nepidemics, disasters etc.\n\n1.1.7 The present architecture of the public hospitals is not equipped fully to handle the critical\nrequirement of clinical management of affected patients while maintaining essential\nservices during periods of public health challenges posed by pandemics such as the current\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Many of the hospital buildings currently available do not have the\nprovision for segregating a part of the building as an infectious diseases treatment block\\\nwing. As a result, in order to avoid mixing of COVID and non-COVID patients, at many places\nfull hospitals were required to be designated as COVID Dedicated Facilities. Apart from\nthat, at many district headquarters, especially in districts with largely rural settings, district\nhospital is the only hospital available where critical care services can be provided to people.\nAs a result, either large amounts of expenses are necessitated on account of transportation\nof patients to other districts or in case the only available hospital is designated as the COVID\n(pandemic) dedicated hospitals, there is a severe adverse impact on the other essential\nservices such as institutional deliveries, blood transfusion services, dialysis and chemotherapy\netc. Strengthening all the districts with Critical Care Hospital Blocks of 50-100 beds as per\nthe population size, will enable the public healthcare system at the district level to respond\nadequately during the public health challenges posed by future pandemics and in periods\nof epidemic outbreaks and enable the health systems to also maintain the essential health\nservices in such times. In other times when there is no epidemic, these blocks will continue\nto provide health services, especially for critical care.\n\n1.1.8. The disease burden in the country also demonstrates the need for provision of high\nquality laboratory services at district and block levels. Delays in diagnosis compromise\nearly detection and initiation of appropriate treatment. In the case of infectious disease\noutbreaks, such delays can lead to widespread community transmission.\n\n1.1.9. Both general and out of hours laboratory services (e.g. emergency services, critical care\nservices) are being provided through laboratories that are largely fragmented. Also, public\nhealth surveillance for abnormal morbidity/mortality, reporting of human or animal disease\npatterns and testing of samples etc. for public health needs remains a weak area in most\ndistricts.\n\n1.1.10. The present public healthcare system structure at the Block level is not equipped to handle\npublic health emergencies and also to respond and monitor the healthcare services. Every\nBlock in the Country is envisaged to have a Community Health Centre (CHC) at the Block\nheadquarter and serve as a hub for referral from the Sub-Health Centres (SHCs) and Primary\nHealth Centres (PHCs) within the block. However, the status of availability of CHCs across"}
{"page": 9, "text": "Operational Guidelines for PM Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission\nstates is highly variable, with the block level CHC in some states in effect being just another\nPHC. In some other states, the block CHC, on the other hand, is also a First Referral Unit. The\nfunctions of a Block CHC are mostly focused on clinical services that too largely RMNCH+A\nand selected infectious diseases. The outbreak of COVID-19 has highlighted a constrained\npublic health response as a result of a suboptimal public health focus at the block level.\n\n1.1.11. The COVID-19 pandemic has also highlighted the various challenges faced in provisioning\nof trained human resources. Experience suggests that as the pandemic evolves and as the\nexperts gain a better understanding of the epidemiology and virulence of the disease,\nthe training needs also evolve. With a pandemic like COVID-19 which is a new infection,\nexperimentation in arriving at the best treatment protocol also leads to changing training\nneeds. The Ministry has set up the iGOT training platform for online training of healthcare\nprofessionals. More importantly over a period of last 5 months, the Central Institutions of\nExcellence such as the AIIMS Delhi, PGI Chandigarh etc. have assumed the much needed\nmentorship role for building confidence of the healthcare professional providing treatment\nservices to the patients, be it about personal protection, infection prevention, plasma\ntherapy, patient monitoring or about the best possible line to treatment. These institutions\nhave also acted as training sites (albeit the trainings being largely offsite!!) for the healthcare\nprofessional and for undertaking clinical studies to inform further policy direction. This\nMinistry has set up INIs like AIIMS Delhi and several other large hospitals cum teaching\ninstitutes such as Safdarjung and RML Hospital. Also, 22 new AIIMS are being established\nunder the Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY). These are tertiary healthcare,\nmedical education and research institutes. In addition, the Ministry of HRD also operates 2\nadvanced medical education and tertiary healthcare institutes/ hospitals. However, these\nhospitals have not been designed to deal with infectious disease patients. Infectious disease\nhospitals are specially designed, with negative pressure systems and other special features\nto control spread of the infectious disease.\n\n1.1.12. The complexity of COVID-19 pandemic, which has spread to over 150 Countries in the\nWorld, has highlighted the need of having competent core capacities for surveillance and\nresponse, diagnostic labs, logistics (including PPEs, Masks, Sanitizers and Disinfectants) and\nappropriate quarantine and isolation facilities at various levels. During the course of past 3-4\nmonths, the Country has faced numerous challenges like quarantine of evacuees (for China,\nIran, Italy), widespread migration, containment of complex clusters and development of\ndiagnostic capacities across the Country.\n\n1.1.13. The 40 metro cities (including Tier I and Tier II cities) presently do not have any infrastructure\nfor regular surveillance for community based health measures and health facilities.\nSimilarly, implementation of the Integrated Health Information Platform (IHIP), an IT\nenabled comprehensive surveillance platform has also only been implemented in 7 states.\nCapacities for timely data collection, collation and analytics also need strengthening.\nThe Epidemiological Intelligence Service, housed in the NCDC has been instrumental in\ncontaining recent out breaks of Nipah in Kerala and Zika in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh.\nHowever, the EIS too needs to be strengthened to have the capacity to effectively lead the\ntechnical response to pandemics of the magnitude of COVID-19."}
{"page": 10, "text": "Operational Guidelines for PM Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission\n\n1.1.14. There is a need for an integrated surveillance program at all levels (Zonal and State\nlevels) and also its expansion to various metro cities. It is also envisaged that the IT level\nsurveillance network is developed, so that that there is uninterrupted data flow particularly\nsites of screening to tracking in the community and further linking it up with diagnostic\nlaboratories and isolation hospitals. The proposal encompasses strengthening of all Divisions\nof NCDC focused on applied public health and epidemiological intelligence, building\ncapacity for emerging and re-emerging infections, surveillance and its evaluation, National\nprogram for anti-microbial resistance (AMR) containment under the One health approach,\nbiosafety-biosecurity, occupational safety & climate change, and building of competencies\namong front line health care workers for strengthening community surveillance at National,\nRegional and District levels.\n\n1.1.15. A major impediment for quick response mechanism is non-availability of dedicated\nsecondary/ tertiary level medical facilities near the disaster site due to damage to the\nhealth facilities. In major public health emergencies such as COVID-19, the health system\ngets overwhelmed and there is need to deploy field hospitals. With increasing frequency of\nnatural and man-made disasters, incl. complex emergencies, a pressing need has been felt\nfor development of quick response medical clinical teams. Keeping this in mind, WHO under\nits “Global EMT (Emergency Medical Team) Initiative” calls for quality assured, accredited,\nself-sufficient in every aspect wherein, member countries deploy medical teams in another\nmember country during times of disasters, natural calamities as per the need of the host\ncountry. This also gives an opportunity for countries providing EMTs not only to strengthen\nits system to global standards but also deploy these teams for internal requirements. It is\nenvisaged to develop these capacities through the Health Emergency Operation Centres\n(HEOCs) and the self-contained container based mobile hospitals.\n\n1.1.16. Emerging infections continue to disrupt the health care system and are becoming\nincreasingly complicated to detect and treat successfully. The public health system is\ncontinually reminded of the challenges posed by the unexpected, whether it is the pandemic\nor a bioterrorist act. Thus, there is increasing need to strengthen the infrastructure for\ncreating favourable environment for epidemiological studies on virus outbreak and other\npathogens related to public health importance.\n\n1.1.17. There is need for setting up institutions which can serve to advance an evolving science of\ndisease elimination to design and develop theoretical, quantitative, qualitative, behavioural\nand applied research practice in order to better translate evidences to policy in partnership\nwith other research institutes, national programs and international organizations towards\nmaking time bound promise of communicable disease elimination a reality.\n\n1.1.18. Emergence of highly infectious and pathogenic viral infections cause significant burden\non public health system. It becomes difficult controlling such diseases, which are highly\ninfectious and pathogenic in nature and have zoonotic origin or spread by aerosols or\nvectors. Recently, our country has witnessed recent emergence of infections like Ebola,\nH5N1, CCHF, KFD, Nipah, H7N9, and MARS CoV, SARS CoV 1 & 2. This has shown countrywide\nneed of enhancing laboratory capacity, networking of institutions dealing with emerging"}
{"page": 11, "text": "Operational Guidelines for PM Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission\nviral diseases of zoonotic importance for by sharing the expertise, reagents and various\ntrainings including biosafety and biosecurity to laboratory management to deal with these.\n\n1.1.19. COVID 19 has shown that significant investments are needed to strengthen public health\nsystems. Without additional funding, the health system will not only fail to respond to\noutbreaks/disasters and other emergencies but also be ineffective in delivering other\nessential services, delaying and disrupting the country’s progress towards the achievements\nof the goals and targets of the National Health Policy 2017 (NHP, 2017) and the Sustainable\nDevelopment Goals. (SDGs).\n1.2 FEATURES OF THE SCHEME\n1.2.1 OBJECTIVES OF PM AYUSHMAN BHARAT HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE MISSION\n\n1.2.1.1 To strengthen grass root public health institutions to deliver universal Comprehensive\nPrimary Health Care, including surveillance, active community engagement and improved\nrisk communication, health education and prevention; and to strengthen public health\ninstitutions and public health governance capacities, to meet challenges posed by the\ncurrent and future pandemics/epidemics with capacities for comprehensive diagnostic and\ntreatment including for critical care services.\n\n1.2.1.2 To expand and build an IT enabled disease surveillance system by developing a network of\nsurveillance laboratories at block, district, regional and national levels, Points of Entry and\nin Metropolitan areas, for effectively detecting, investigating, preventing and combating\nPublic Health Emergencies and Disease Outbreaks.\n\n1.2.1.3 To support research on COVID-19 and other infectious diseases, including biomedical\nresearch to generate evidence to inform short-term and medium-term response to COVID-19\nlike pandemics and to develop core capacity to deliver the One Health Approach to prevent,\ndetect, and respond to infectious disease outbreaks in animals and humans.\n1.2.2 COMPONENTS OF PM AYUSHMAN BHARAT HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE MISSION\nThe Scheme is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme with some Central Sector components.

Medical Colleges will also be engaged to\nprovide specific skill based training and also mentor and support Health and Wellness\nCentres in rural and urban areas. Learning from the COVID 19 experience, capacity building\nfor all cadres will include content to enable activities related to outbreak management so\nthat they can be repurposed for contact tracing/surveillance, etc in future pandemics.\n\n2.1.14 Initiatives such as the Integrated Health Information Platform (IHIP) and the National Digital\nHealth ecosystem will enable the development of expertise and knowledge sharing across"}

Integrating these functions into primary health care\nis the starting point.\n\n2.1.17.2 Sustained and accelerated efforts to operationalize the Ayushman Bharat – Health\nand Wellness Centres (AB-HWCs) will enable attention to community and system level\nprimary health care interventions for preventive, promotive, curative, rehabilitative\nand palliative care. Services cover those related to RMNCHA+N communicable\ndiseases, common non-communicable diseases, including mental health, care for\nthe elderly, and basic emergency and trauma care. The provision of free medicines,\ndiagnostics and access to telemedicine services close to community is expected to\nexpand coverage and quality of primary health care and reduce patient hardship\nand improve quality of care. Effective primary health care delivery also includes\nundertaking public health functions through community and facility level action for\nsurveillance, screening and early detection, vector control, etc.\n\n2.1.17.3 To provide seamless continuum of care between primary, secondary, and tertiary\nlevels, HWC would be linked with the AB-PMJAY for those covered under the scheme,\nin rural and urban areas. Strengthening of secondary care facilities to provide high\nquality care, initiated under NHM and continued under this proposal would be\nuniversally available to those who seek care in public health facilities."}

{"page": 27, "text": "Infrastructure Support to ‘Building-less’\nSub Health Centre–Health & Wellness Centres\n(SHC-HWCs) in Rural Areas\n3.1 BACKGROUND\n\n3.1.1 It is important to strengthen the Public Health System, not only, to enable public health\nactions in case of future outbreaks and pandemics (such as early detection, management\nand mitigation), but ensure that essential non-pandemic related health services are\nnot compromised. The Ayushman Bharat – Health and Wellness Centres (AB-HWCs), the\nflagship programme of the Government, will enable attention to community and system\nlevel primary health care interventions for preventive, promotive, curative, rehabilitative\nand palliative care. The provision of free medicines, diagnostics and access to telemedicine\nservices closer to community is expected to expand coverage and quality of primary health\ncare and reduce patient hardship and improve quality of care. Effective primary health care\ndelivery also includes undertaking public health functions through community and facility\nlevel action for surveillance, screening and early detection, vector control, etc.\n\n3.1.2 AB-HWCs offer the opportunity to ensure that girls and women would have access to care not\njust for reproductive health services, but also for the newer elements of the Comprehensive\nPrimary Health Care package including screening, diagnosis, and treatment for hypertension,\ndiabetes and mental health. Since services are provided close to community, access to\nessential services would be sustained for such sub population groups. Teleconsultation\nservices are of particular importance in reducing access barriers for women and will ensure\ngender equity. These centres will not only provide primary level clinical care services for an\nexpanded range of services as per Operational guidelines of Comprehensive Primary Health\nCare and subsequent Operational Guidelines on the expanded range of services at the centre\nbut also ensure outreach services are provided to their catchment population.\n\n3.1.3 Under the AB-HWCs programme, it is envisaged that 1,50,000 AB-HWCs shall be set up\nin the country by December 2022. Out of these, 12,500 HWCs are being setup by the\nMinistry of AYUSH as AYUSH-HWCs. As per Rural Health Statistics, 2020, as on 31st March\n2020, there are 47,518 Sub Health Centres, which are functioning in rented buildings /\npanchayat or voluntary society buildings and these SHCs require building to be constructed.\nThese infrastructure gaps of SHCs are significant especially in 7 High Focus States and"}

Support is\nprovided to the States to have Urban PHCs @50,000 per population. Outreach functions in\nthis population, are undertaken by five ANMs and 20-25 ASHAs, with a normative coverage\nof a population of 10,000 served by a team of one ANM and five ASHAs. Under Ayushman\nBharat, Urban PHCs are being strengthened as Health and Wellness Centres (UPHC-HWCs)\nto deliver Comprehensive Primary Health Care (CPHC).\n\n4.1.2 Healthcare needs and aspirations of urban residents are different from those in rural areas.\nThe current strategy of relying on outreach teams of ANM and ASHA alone to provide\nselective services is not sufficient. State experiences demonstrate that provision of health\ncare services by trained service providers from facilities closer to poorer, and vulnerable\nurban communities is likely to improve access to an expanded range of services, reduce\nOOPE, improve disease surveillance, and strengthen referral linkages. At the same time,\nstate experiences also show that the establishment of “poly clinics / provision of specialist\nservices” in selected Urban PHCs, enables reach of specialist services to poor communities,\nthus building trust in the public health system.\n\n4.1.3 Lack of a frontline health workforce in our cities has emerged as one of the biggest limiting\nfactors in our response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, a paradigm shift is envisaged\nin delivery of urban primary healthcare based on the learnings from the management\nof COVID-19 pandemic which has affected urban areas disproportionately, especially\nin metropolitan areas such as Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad,\nAhmedabad, Surat etc. A significant proportion of the urban population also constitutes\nof the migrants from other states. Also, a large proportion of these are usually settled in\ncongested urban settings. Expansion and strengthening of the grass-root primary healthcare\ndelivery institutions has thus emerged as a pressing need in the changed context. Limited\ncapacities of health systems in urban areas and the disruption in non-COVID essential health\nservices also underlines the need for provision of Universal and CPHC capacities in urban\nareas."}

Also, would provide accurate and timely data for analysis, research, information and\npolicy decisions to detect, prevent and respond to public health threats in real time. It will\nsupport block and district surveillance units and act as a hub to provide technical support\nto block public health labs and other peripheral laboratories for sample collection, testing\nand referral as per GoI guidelines.\n\n6.4.2 The IPHLs will be a key platform to establish close integration and coordination between\nhealth and other concerned departments like veterinary, water, food and environment, forest,\nand climate change, etc. Such close integration and coordination at the district level to be\nestablished with existing laboratories under various departments like Central Pollution\nControl Board (CPCB), FSSAI, PHED, veterinary, forensic department, etc. This will help\nin sharing of data, time-bound reporting of identified investigations of public health\nimportance between the departments\n\n6.4.3 There are the District hospitals which have been either merged or upgraded into Medical\nColleges, but their labs are only providing clinical services. All such District Hospitals\nLaboratory need to continue providing public health functions including outbreak\ninvestigations.\n\n6.4.4 For making the lab functional there is a need to assess the existing type of diagnostic\nservices being provided at the facility, existing human resource, capacity of existing HR,\navailable equipment, available space in and around existing laboratories. In case, there is\nno scope within the constructed area of lab, preferably in the adjoining space/ area in the\nexisting DH needs to be identified for IPHL.\n\n6.4.5 The existing clinical laboratories, public health laboratories or any other program laboratory\nneed to be mapped and restructured to provide comprehensive services as envisaged under\nDistrict IPHL.\n\n6.4.6 An ideal IPHL design should have two components- a central sample collection facility and\nan integrated diagnostic testing facility. Both these components can be established as a\ncombined unit on the same floor or in parts at different floors.\n\n6.4.7 Development of IPHL will involve physical, functional and data integration of different\nsections of the district hospital laboratories.\n\ni.\nThe physical integration will include establishment of a central sample collection facility\nin a patient-friendly location.\n\nii.\nThe functional integration will require various vertical program sections to operate as\nthe coordinated limbs of a single body i.e. the district public health laboratory, in the\nprocess, sharing space, manpower and the equipment thus avoiding duplication and\ndisconnect."}
{"page": 45, "text": "Operational Guidelines for PM Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission\n\n6.4.8 The State shall mandate the quality check of the constructed facilities as per the norms set\nby the State in accordance with the other construction works undertaken. The State should\nensure third party monitoring and quality checks to ensure that the works undertaken\nmeet the required quality parameters and are constructed as per the terms and conditions\ndecided by the State.\n6.5 IDENTIFICATION OF FACILITY, APPROVALS AND OPERATIONALIZATION\n\n6.5.1 Setting-up of District IPHL: District IPHL needs to be set up in an existing DH by\nreorganizing the existing district clinical lab. Wherever, District Public Health Laboratory\n(DPHL) is existing, needs to be integrated with IPHL as per the protocols defined in the\nguidelines. For making the labs functional, there is a need to assess the existing type\nof diagnostic services being provided at the facility, existing human resource, capacity of\nexisting HR, available equipment, available space in and around existing laboratories. In\ncase, there is no scope within the constructed area of lab, some adjoining space/ area in\nthe existing DH needs to be identified for IPHL.\n\n6.5.2 Services: Integrated District Public Laboratory (IPHL) will conduct clinical and public health\ndiagnostic tests as per Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS) under one roof. Provide support\nto routine surveillance and outbreak investigation of Infectious diseases, may perform\nenvironmental investigations (such as water culture for coliforms) and rapid diagnostic tests\nto support outbreak investigations, as and when needed.\n\n6.5.3 Most of the lab tests indicated at the IPHLs are part of IPHS. In case of any additional lab\ntests (like Microbiological analysis of water, etc.), the capacity needs to be enhanced as per\nthe vision of IPHS. Similarly, under free diagnostics, through hub and spoke models many\ndistrict labs have already been augmented and in order to improve the testing capability\nmany new equipment have also been added with support of funding from NHM. Since\ncommitment of IPHL is beyond clinical lab services, the requirements for public health\nsurveillance, infectious disease etc. also needs to be part of the system.\n\n6.5.4 In many states the diagnostic services are outsourced, and this commitment could be for\ndifferent time periods and vary in terms of the number of tests covered. While planning and\nestablishing IPHLs, focus may be laid to ensure that the population is able to benefit from\nthe extended range of services as envisaged under these guidelines.\n\n6.5.5 The flow of services in IPHL is critical for ensuring functional integration which requires the\nvarious vertical program sections to operate as the coordinated limbs of a single body – the\ndistrict public health lab, in the process sharing the space, manpower and the equipment\navoid duplication and disconnect.\n\n6.5.6 Infrastructure: The existing facility may be re-structured/re-organised, or a new facility\ncan be established (in-case enough space not available). However, while demolishing any\nold building, it should be ensured that alternate arrangements are made for effectively\nrunning the existing services. For the proper functioning of IPHLs, there is a need to assess"}
{"page": 46, "text": "Operational Guidelines for PM Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission\nthe available space in and around the existing lab and in case there is no scope within the\nconstructed area of the lab, some adjoining space/ area in the existing DH needs to be\nidentified for IPHL. The new space can be utilised ideally vertically but can be developed\nhorizontally if ample space is available.\n\n6.5.7 The layout of the lab is based on the range of services to be provided. However, planning should\nbe prospective and taking into account expected burden of disease and epidemiological\ntransition. Thus, new structures should be planned, designed and constructed taking into\naccount the scope for future expansion. Broadly, the structure will include following units:\n\n• Central sample collection facility and\n\n• Integrated Laboratory (clinical and public health testing facility).\n\n• Auxiliary Area\n\n6.5.8 Human Resource:\n\ni.\nThe existing HR functional in various labs and norms suggested under IPHS shall be the\nbasis for calculating the existing lab staff and what is required for implementing IPHL.\nUnder District IPHL, the duplication of the staff will be eliminated, and HR will be utilized\ncomprehensive and inclusive of all programs.  IPHS defines the minimum performance\nstandard for lab technicians as 200 tests per day. The HR requirement / support will be\nbased on this.\n\nii.\nThere should be a system for regular induction and refresher training and each laboratory\nstaff should undergo at least trainings on documentation (specimen handling manual,\nspecimen request form, specimen logbook, acceptance/rejection criteria, critical alerts,\ninventory management, result reporting format, IQC records etc.), SOP development,\nsample collection, packaging and transport, laboratory safety, infection prevention and\nbiosafety cabinet certification and practical training on syndrome based-diagnostic\ntesting, including internal quality control.\n\niii.\nIPHL staff should be responsible for training and mentorship of Block Public Health\nLaboratory staff. The laboratory in-charge will be responsible for training and\ncompetency assessment of laboratory staff. A system for regular induction and refresher\ntraining (yearly) shall be developed for different levels of laboratory staff.\n\n6.5.9 A new addition in the PH lab is Lab Information Management system (LIMS). This needs to\nbe linked with existing data reporting system of the hospital which will ultimately feed into\nthe electronic health information system i.e. Integrated Health Information Platform (IHIP).\nThe lab data reporting system will include all the surveillance data being reported from the\nintegrated block PH unit. This will help in improving analyzing capacity of the local units so\nthat early response for mitigation can be taken.\n\n6.5.10 Equipment: A list and specifications of important equipment is given in the revised free\ndiagnostic initiative guidelines. Support for diagnostics is available from various sources like\nNHM, State resources and also under PM Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission.\nWhile projecting the needs of the facility, all the available equipment either under various\nprograms or from different sources must be taken into account."}

{"page": 50, "text": "Critical Care Hospital Blocks\n7.1 BACKGROUND\n\n7.1.1 The COVID pandemic has highlighted the need for critical care facilities, especially at\nthe level of the districts. The country’s increasing disease burden particularly related to\nthe sequelae of chronic communicable and non-communicable diseases and injury also\nrequires access to critical care. Non-communicable diseases and injuries account for 61.8%\nand 10.7% deaths respectively. (Source: India: Health of the Nation’s States, ICMR).\n\n7.1.2 Average medical expenditure per hospitalization (both rural and urban, private and\npublic combined) is Rs. 20135/- (as per NSSO 2017-18). It is anticipated that about 3-5% of\nemergencies would require ICU facilities and oxygen supported beds for critical care. There is\nan urgent need to strengthen these facilities and create additional amenities (infrastructure,\nequipment etc.), in existing district hospitals to meet such unforeseen epidemics, disasters\netc.\n\n7.1.3 The current architecture of the public hospitals is not equipped fully to handle the dual\nburden of meeting critical care needs and maintaining essential services as was seen during\nthe two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many hospital buildings especially in districts, do\nnot have provision for segregating a part of the building as an infectious disease treatment\nblock/wing. As a result, in order to avoid mixing of COVID and non-COVID patients, entire\nhospitals were required to be designated as COVID Dedicated Facilities, thereby resulting\nin inability to provide non COVID essential services such as institutional deliveries, blood\ntransfusion services, dialysis and chemotherapy etc.\n\n7.1.4 Under PM Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission , Government of India would\nsupport 100 and 50-bedded Hospital Blocks/ Wings to augment the capacity of public health\nfacilities to provide assured critical care. These block/wings will enhance capacity to manage\npatients requiring critical care from the sequelae of infectious diseases, during pandemics,\nor are in need of critical care for any other condition, including during emergencies.\n\n7.1.5 The 100 and 50-bedded Critical Care Hospital Block/Wings would be self-contained, and be\nequipped with critical, supportive and ancillary services such as Emergency area, Intensive\nCare Units (ICU), Isolation Wards/Oxygen supported beds, Surgical unit, two labour, delivery,\nrecovery rooms (LDRs) with one New-born care corner.

However, for the sake of clarity the higher number of\nbeneficiary families appearing in either SECC Database or Existing RSBY\nBeneficiary Families will be considered for deciding the eligible beneficiary\nfamilies. The aforesaid benefit cover will be able to take care of almost all\nsecondary care and most of tertiary care procedure. Upon launch of AB-NHPM,\nthe existing Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY) and Senior Citizen Health\nInsurance Scheme (SCHIS) being implemented by States will be subsumed in AB-\nNHPM.\n\n1. Sharing Pattern Ratio – For Premium and Administrative Expenses\n\n The actual premium discovered through open tendering process or the\nmaximum ceiling of the estimated premium decided by Government of\nIndia for the implementation of AB-NHPM, whichever is less and this would\nbe shared between Central Government and States / UTs in the ratio as per\nthe extant directives issued by Ministry of Finance in vogue, from time to\ntime. The existing sharing pattern ratio is 60:40 between the Central\nGovernment and the States Government / Union Territories, for States and\nUnion Territories which are other than North-Eastern & Three Himalayan\nStates and Union Territories, which does have Legislation; and\n For North-Eastern and Three Himalayan States (viz. Jammu and Kashmir,\nHimachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand), the sharing pattern ratio between the\nCentral and State Governments will be 90:10; and\n For Union Territories, without Legislation, the Central Government may\nprovide upto 100% on a case to case basis.\n\n2.

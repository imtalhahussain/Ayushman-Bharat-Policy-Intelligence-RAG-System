{"page": 3, "text": "Preface\n\nNational Health Agency\nMinistry of Health and Family Welfare\nGovernment of India\n\nAyushman Bharat – Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana endeavours to offer health coverage of Rs.\n5,00,000 to more than 10 crore beneficiary families, that is more than 40 percent of the country’s\npopulation. This unprecedented effort of the Government of India is likely to have a significant impact\non the poor and vulnerable population’s access to secondary and tertiary hospital care.\n\nGlobal experience shows that integrity violations in health insurance programmes are high. Fraud in\nsuch programmes not only result in financial losses but have a much greater impact on people’s\nhealth. The ultimate responsibility to effectively prevent, detect, and deter fraud lies with the State\nHealth Agencies (SHA). Strong anti-fraud efforts are important not only from the perspective of\nreducing the adverse impact on scheme finances and for safeguarding beneficiary health but also to\nmitigate any reputational risk faced by the SHA, state and the scheme resulting from fraud.\n\nHence, SHA’s anti-fraud efforts are key for ensuring effective implementation of PMJAY and it is critical\nthat a “zero tolerance” approach to fraud be internalized and permeate all aspects of management of\nthe scheme.\n\nWith this spirit, the National Health Agency is sharing the National Anti-Fraud Guidelines for the\nPMJAY and look forward to feedback from stakeholders for strengthening this. We sincerely hope that\nstate governments participating in PMJAY will use these guidelines to strengthen the governance and\nmanagement of PMJAY in their respective states.\n\nDr. Indu Bhushan\nChief Executive Officer"}

The\napproach to anti-fraud efforts shall be based on five founding principles: Transparency,\nAccountability, Responsibility, Independence, and Reasonability.\nFraud management\napproaches\nStages of implementation\nPrevention\n-\nBeneficiary identification and verification\n-\nProvider empanelment\n-\nPre-authorisation\nDetection\n-\nClaims management\n-\nMonitoring\n-\nAudits\nDeterrence\n-\nContract management\n-\nEnforcement of contractual provisions"}
{"page": 6, "text": "Understanding the terms:\ni.\nTransparency shall mean public disclosure in decision making and in disclosing\ninformation as necessary in relation to PMJAY fraud.\nii.\nAccountability shall mean clear functions, structures, systems, and accountability for\nservices for effective management.\niii.\nResponsibility shall mean management’s conformity or compliance with sound\norganizational principles for PMJAY anti-fraud efforts.\niv.\nIndependence shall mean a condition where the SHA is managed professionally\nwithout conflict of interest and under no compulsion or pressure from any party.\nv.\nReasonability shall mean fair and equal treatment to fulfil stakeholders’ rights arising\nfrom agreements in PMJAY anti-fraud efforts.\n\n2.2 Definition of fraud under PMJAY:\n\n2.2.1\nFraud under the PMJAY shall mean and include any intentional deception, manipulation of\nfacts and / or documents or misrepresentation made by a person or organization with the\nknowledge that the deception could result in unauthorized financial or other benefit to\nherself/himself or some other person or\norganisation. It includes any act that may\nconstitute fraud under any applicable law in\nIndia.\n\n2.2.2\nIn addition to the above, any act (indicative list\nbelow) that is recognised by different provisions\nof the Indian Penal Code as fraud shall be\ndeemed to be fraud under the PMJAY:\n\na. Impersonation\nb. Counterfeiting\nc. Misappropriation\nd. Criminal breach of trust\ne. Cheating\nf.\nForgery\ng. Falsification\nh. Concealment\n\n2.2.3 Human errors and waste are not included in the definition of fraud1.\n\n1 ‘Errors’ are un-intention mistakes during the process of healthcare delivery (like prescribing wrong medications\nto a patient). ‘Waste’ refers to unintentional inadvertent use of resources (prescribing high cost medicines\nwhen generic versions are available). ‘Abuse’ refers to those provider practices that are inconsistent with sound\nfiscal, business, or medical practices, and result in an unnecessary cost to the PMJAY, or in reimbursement for\nservices that are not medically necessary or that fail to meet professionally recognized standards for health care.\nIt also includes beneficiary practices that result in unnecessary cost to the PMJAY. Whereas fraud is wilful and\ndeliberate, involves financial gain, is done under false pretence and is illegal, abuse generally fails to meet one\nor more of these criteria. The main purpose of both fraud and abuse is financial and non-financial gain. Few\nexamples of common health insurance abuse would be - excessive diagnostic tests, extended length of stay and\nconversion of day procedure to overnight admission.\n\nIndian Contract Act 1972, Section 17:\n“Fraud” means and includes any of the\nfollowing acts committed by a party to a\ncontract, or with his connivance, or by his\nagent, with intent to deceive another party\nthereto of his agent, or to induce him to\nenter into the contract:\n1. the suggestion, as a fact, of that which is\nnot true, by one who does not believe it\nto be true;\n2. the active concealment of a fact by one\nhaving knowledge or belief of the fact;\n3. a promise made without any intention of\nperforming it;\n4. any other act fitted to deceive;\n5. any such act or omission as the law\nspecially declares to be fraudulent."}

The Governing Body of the SHA should approve the state Anti-Fraud Guidelines prior\nto implementing the PMJAY. The SHA should ensure that all staff are trained on the approved\nstate Anti-Fraud Guidelines.\n\n5.1.2\nDevelop referral protocols for benefits that are more prone to fraud and abuse. Procedures\nor certain benefits under PMJAY that are more prone to fraud may be either reserved only for\nempanelled public providers or can be availed only on referral from a public provider. The SHA\nshould issue appropriate orders to this effect."}
{"page": 15, "text": "5.1.3\nEnsure that all contracts signed by the SHA with any party (Insurer, ISA, TPA, provider, IT\nagency, etc.) have adequate anti-fraud provisions that are enforceable. The SHA should\nensure that all model contracts available on PMJAY website that are adapted by the states\nhave a clear definition of abuse and fraud, what constitutes abuse and fraud and what are\ntheir consequences. Liabilities of different parties concerned should be clearly spelt out in the\ncontract. The SHA should ensure that the contracts have adequate disincentives and penalties\nfor abuse and fraud.\n\n5.1.4\nPreventing empanelment fraud: The SHA shall ensure strict compliance to the NHA guidelines\nfor empanelment of providers. In addition, to further reduce empanelment related fraud, the\nSHA may publish hospital-wise empanelment assessment scores on PMJAY website of the\nstate to allow any third party to report false capacity representation made by any provider.\nAnnual assessment / audit of all empanelled providers by an independent agency with\nrelevant experience is recommended to ensure compliance to the minimum empanelment\ncriteria. Extra caution should be exercised during initial and follow up providers assessments\nespecially in those states that have provisions of awarding assessment grades and have\ndifferential grade-based tariff.\n\n5.1.5\nBeneficiary identification / verification: The SHA shall ensure strict compliance to NHA\nguidelines for beneficiary verification. For beneficiary fraud prevention, the Anti-Fraud Cell\nshall track the conversion of beneficiary records from ‘silver’ to ‘gold’, which indicates that\nthe beneficiary details are verified. When a beneficiary reports to an empanelled provider for\ntreatment, the Arogya Mitra enters the beneficiary details on the Beneficiary Identification\nSystem of the transaction software. After the beneficiary verification is complete, the record\nis inserted into the system as a ‘Silver’ record, which gets converted to ‘Golden Record’ after\nfurther verification and approval by the designated authorities. For further details, refer to\nthe NHA guidelines on ‘Arogya Mitras’ and ‘Guidelines on Process of Beneficiary Identification’\navailable on the NHA website.\n\n5.1.6\nPre-authorisation: The SHA shall ensure strict compliance to NHA guidelines for pre-\nauthorisation. In addition, to further strengthen the efforts to pre-authorisation fraud, the\nSHA shall:\n\na. Develop detailed pre-authorisation protocols and automate the process including\nmandatory submissions into the claims management software as an automated workflow\nprocess;\nb.

The SHA shall ensure strict compliance to NHA guidelines for claims management.\nb. Claim data analysis for early detection of fraud shall be conducted fortnightly by the\nAnti-Fraud Cell.\nc. Such claim data analysis shall be conducted through the following approaches:\ni.\nIdentifying data anomalies trigger based and rule-based analysis;\nii.\nAdvanced algorithms for fraud detection, predictive / regression based and\nmachine learning models and other advanced data analytics reports received\nby the SHA from the NHA or as requested by the SHA to the NHA, provided\nthe SHA makes all claims data available to the NHA for analysis.\n\nd. In conducting claim data analysis, the Anti-Fraud Cell may coordinate with the medical\naudit team of the SHA, claims processors and adjudicators in the TPA / ISA or the CRC\nor the MMRC (refer to Section 4.4) and other parties as necessary.\n\n5.2.2\nFraud detection during routine monitoring and verification: The key to an effective anti-fraud\nand abuse programme is to gather information on provider performance. The Anti-Fraud Cell\nwithin the SHA should combine the following techniques to detect fraud:\n\na. Data analysis comparing providers on such indices as utilization, performance,\noutcomes, referrals, disenrollment, followed by focused reviews on areas of\naberrancy;\nb. Routine reviews on particular problem areas;\nc. Routine validation of provider data;\nd. Random reviews and beneficiary interviews;\ne. Unannounced site visits; and\nf.\nUse of feedback and quality improvement.\n\n5.2.3\nComparative analysis: The Anti-Fraud Cell may elect to perform a comparison of empanelled\nproviders within districts or state-wide. Individual patterns of providers may not be\nsignificantly unusual but the cumulative pattern within a provider may require further review.\nIt is recommended that the SHA’s data systems be used to identify benefit utilization patterns\nthat may assist in the case development and in the review.\n\n5.2.4\nRoutine reviews on problem areas: As part of its fraud and abuse strategy, the Anti-Fraud Cell\nmay identify areas of a focus that will receive special attention during routine monitoring of\nprovider activities. These areas should be identified through systematic risk assessment, and\ncould include, but not be limited to, items such as:\n\na. ensuring that providers within networks are eligible to participate in PMJAY;\nb. ensuring that beneficiaries claimed as enrolled are in fact enrolled;\nc. ensuring that provider employees understand PMJAY guidelines, can define fraud,\nand know where, how, and when to report it."}
{"page": 17, "text": "5.2.5\nRandom reviews and beneficiary interviews: The SHA should plan for a minimum level of\nrandom reviews, in which a selected universe of beneficiaries are contacted for interviews.\nMedical records should also be reviewed to identify any possible errors or evidence of abuse\nand/or fraud. All such reviews shall be as per the guidelines issued by the NHA from time to\ntime.\n\n5.2.6\nUnannounced site visits: SHA monitoring plans should include unannounced provider visits,\nparticularly to those providers for which some significant concerns exist. During unannounced\nprovider visits, reviewers can observe encounters, interview beneficiaries or employees,\nconfirm the accuracy of facility-based information, and/or review records.\n\n5.2.7\nUse of feedback and quality improvement: The results of reviews (including feedback\nfrom local communities, health workers) and investigations should be used to improve\nPMJAY implementation systems.

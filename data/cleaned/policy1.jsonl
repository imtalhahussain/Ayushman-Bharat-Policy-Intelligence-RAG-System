{"page": 5, "text": "5 | P a g e\n\nI. Introduction of AB PM-JAY\n\nAyushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB PM-JAY) is the world’s largest health\nassurance scheme fully financed by the government. It is the flagship scheme of the\nGovernment of India, launched on 23rd Sep 2018, to achieve the vision of Universal Health\nCoverage (UHC). The scheme possesses the potential to bring a paradigm shift in the\nhealthcare sector of the nation and aims at reducing the financial burden on poor and vulnerable\ngroups arising out of catastrophic hospital episodes.\n\nThe scheme aims to create a system of healthcare facilities that meet the immediate\nhospitalization needs of the eligible beneficiary family in a cashless manner thus insulating the\nfamily from the associated financial crisis.\n\nThree years further on, the scheme has empanelled ~26,000 private & public hospitals which\ninclude a wide array of facilities. Even though, the primary responsibility of healthcare providers\nis to provide treatment to patients, services to PM-JAY beneficiaries must be provided in\nalignment with the contours of the scheme and in compliance with PM-JAY’s fundamental\nprinciples, policy and practice.\n\nFor hospitals empanelment, the empanelment committees at the national, state and district\nlevels have defined a set of guidelines to be followed and requirements that need to be fulfilled\nfor the empanelment process. Once empanelled, the hospitals (also referred as Empanelled\nHealthcare Providers) are provided with required handholding support regarding Information\nTechnology (IT) systems, training, Information Education and Communication (IEC), health\nbenefit packages, quality, etc.\n\nThe scheme has many unique features, some of which are illustrated below:"}
{"page": 6, "text": "6 | P a g e\n\nII. Purpose of Hospital Operations Manual\n\nAyushman Bharat- Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB PM-JAY) is a nationwide health\nassurance scheme with a focus on providing coverage to about 10.74 crore families that form\nthe vulnerable population group. The scheme not only takes pride in being a major step in\nmoving towards Universal Health Coverage (UHC). The key to the success of the scheme has\nbeen the public and private sector working hand in hand to provide better healthcare services\nto the beneficiaries. As of November 2021, the scheme has a network of around 25,881\nempaneled public and private hospitals across 36 States and Union Territories of India. This\nnetwork of hospitals has proven to be pivotal in the successful implementation of the scheme.\n\nSince inception of the scheme, it has been our experience that hospitals that intent to join the\nscheme and those that are a part of the network, undergo several changes and in the process,\nface varied challenges. As per the guidelines, hospitals need to fulfill a certain criterion to be\nable to initiate the process of empanelment. Thereafter, the hospitals also need to maintain a\nminimum standard of requirements of human resource, hardware, training, awareness (IEC),\netc. to be able to maintain the requisite quality of care.\n\nSince this increasing network of hospitals requires continuous support, the National Health\nAuthority has developed this document, ‘Operations Manual for EHCPs’ that would serve as a\nguidebook for the empaneled hospitals. This manual would be a one-stop reference for the\nEHCPs to access the guidelines and SOPs and facilitate them in streamlining their processes\nwith respect to the functioning of the scheme. With the aim of providing a detailed understanding\nof the not just the systems across the scheme, this comprehensive document also offers an\ninsight into the organization structure at NHA as well as defines the role of each vertical and the\nrespective guidelines laid down for the hospitals. The reader may access the resource material\nthrough the links provided in the different sections of the document.\n\nNHA had also developed a brief guideline on “Streamlining Systems & Processes at Hospitals\nfor AB-PMJAY” that provides information about required eligibility criteria prior to empanelment,\nprovisions to procure necessary hardware, recruitment of Arogya Mitras for service delivery,\ncapacity building, kiosk setup, IEC, process of raising pre-auth & using TMS, setting up of corpus\nfund, procurement of medicines, diagnostics & investigation process etc. The guidelines on\n“Streamlining Systems & Processes at Hospitals for AB-PMJAY” for reference are available on\nAB PM-JAY website using following link: https://pmjay.gov.in/resources/documents.\n\nThe Operational Manual is a comprehensive and updated guideline based on recent\nimprovement in the AB PM-JAY system and processes and aims to provide a thorough\nunderstanding of the proposed process, and other related activities for the improved\nengagements of EHCPs. Additionally, information about do’s and don’ts for EHCPs has also\nbeen mentioned as annexure-1 that may be used for reference."}

Benefits for EHCPs under AB PM-JAY\n\nBecause of the scale of coverage of the scheme, Ayushman Bharat (AB PM-JAY) is a unique\nprogramme owing to the numerous stakeholders involved. The scheme offers several\nadvantages to the key stakeholders of the scheme, i.e., beneficiaries, service providers, SHAs,\nTPA & insurance agencies. AB PM-JAY is one of the schemes that promotes participation of\nprivate hospitals in Government scheme similar to public hospitals. Some of the unique aspects\nof the scheme are mentioned below:\n\nIncentives for Hospitals: Hospitals will receive incentives over and above basic package rates.\nThe hospitals with better quality standards will be rewarded for the same based on the incentive\nmechanisms shown below. However, the given incentive structure is indicative and might vary\nacross states:\n\nS. No\nCriteria\nIncentive*\nAB PM-JAY Bronze Quality certification\n5%\nNational Level NQAS Certified EHCPs”\n15%\nEntry Level NABH\n10%\nFull NABH accreditation\n15%\nSituated in Metro City#\n10%\nAspirational District$\n10%\nRunning PG/DNB course in the empanelled specialities\n10%\n*Incentive structure is indicative and may vary across States.\n#Metro cities include Delhi (Including Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Noida, Gurugram), Greater Mumbai,\nKolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad and Pune\n$ as per the listed districts by NITI Aayog\n“NQAS incentive will be applicable from 1st April, 2022\n\nLarge Patient base: Ayushman Bharat PM-JAY is the largest health assurance scheme in the\nworld which aims at providing a health cover of Rs. 5 lakhs per family per year for secondary\nand tertiary care hospitalization across public and private empanelled hospitals in India to over\n10.74 crores poor and vulnerable families (approximately 50 crore beneficiaries) that form the\nbottom 40% of the Indian population. The scheme provides a large patient base to hospitals and\nhelps them to fill their unfilled/unoccupied beds. Hospitals may achieve higher revenue without\nspending additional fixed costs on the infrastructure.\n\nPortability: NHA has the provision of providing treatment to AB PM-JAY beneficiaries from\nother states under portability norms that will increase the beneficiary base for empaneled\nhealthcare providers. This feature dissipates state boundaries and will allows patients to access\nEHCPs which provides quality services from across the country and not just their state.\n\nEase of Doing Business for EHCPs:\n•\nTimebound Reimbursement Process: The scheme ensures timely payment of claim\namount within specified TAT (turnaround time). The EHCPs are expected to upload all\nclaim-related documents within 24 hours of discharge of the beneficiary. Further, EHCPs\ncan refer claim adjudication guidelines as amended by NHA/SHA from time to time.\n•\nGrievance Redressal: Any issue faced by the hospitals may be escalated through the\ngrievance redressal system under AB PM-JAY. Hospitals can register grievances\nthrough the portal.\n•\nOnline Transparent System: All EHCPs make use of the IT system to manage the\nclaims-related transactions. IT system has been developed for online transactions and\nall stakeholders are advised to maintain online transactions preferably to ensure the\nclaim reporting in real-time."}

{"page": 13, "text": "13 | P a g e\n\nscheme. Empanelment is one such key aspect which while balancing adequate access would\nalso ensure appropriate patient safety and quality.\n\nCriteria for Empanelment for EHCPs\nConsidering the supply side characteristics, two types of empanelment criteria have been\nevolved.\n\n General criteria – For hospitals that provide non-specialised general medical and surgical\ncare with or without ICU and emergency services.\n\n Speciality criteria (for clinical specialities) – For each speciality, a specific set of criteria\nhas been identified. Under PM-JAY, a hospital is not allowed to select the risk, which means\nit cannot apply for selected specialities and must agree to offer all specialities to PM-JAY\nbeneficiaries that are offered by it. However, to offer a specialised clinical service, the\nhospital must have necessary specific infrastructure and HR in place as mentioned in the\nspecial criteria developed under PM-JAY for the same.\n\nFor further details regarding the guidelines and process, please visit the website on the link,\nhttps://pmjay.gov.in/resources/documents\nand\nrefer\nto\nthe\nHospital\nnetwork\n&\nEmpanelment and Quality Assurance\nLink for HEM portal\nhttps://hospitals.pmjay.gov.in/empApplicationHome.htm?actionVal=loginPage\n\n2. Hospital Empanelment Module (HEM)\n\nA web-based platform Hospital Empanelment Module (HEM) has been developed for\nregistration of a healthcare provider willing to get empanelled under the flagship program\nAB PM-JAY. Every hospital needs to visit the web portal and create an account for themselves\nand must show a willingness to empanel itself. The system allows registering the hospital, after\nthe hospital's consent for empanelment. Further, HEM creates an account with an exclusive\nhospital reference number and password. Using these credentials, the hospital has to login into\nthe system to start filling the application form with the following sections:\n\nUser section\nCivil infrastructure\nHospital basic information\nMedical infrastructure\nFinancial details\nGeneral services\nSpecialities offered\nMan-power details\nLicenses and certifications\n\nFurther, HEM portal will be helpful for the EHCPs in case they need to update (change of contact\ndetails, change in specialities etc.) on the aforesaid information after empanelment by using\nHEM login credentials.\n\nSubsequent to empanelment, hospital needs basic infrastructure, manpower, training, capacity\nbuilding on various aspects of AB PM-JAY, engagement with ISA/TPA/Insurance agencies,\ncoordination with district/state/national authorities of AB PM-JAY, IEC, M&R etc. The chapters\nindicated herein will discuss the support extended to EHCPs at various level considering\nhospital’s journey under AB PM-JAY."}
{"page": 14, "text": "14 | P a g e\n\n3. Capacity Building\n\nSince, AB PM-JAY is one of the largest health insurance scheme, it requires efficient utilization\nof resources across all levels, i.e. healthcare providers, insurance companies, development\nagencies, others. To achieve the noble objectives of the scheme, capacity building forms an\nintegral part of the system and has the following objectives:\n•\nTo define structures and systems with specific roles for all stakeholders in PM-JAY\nincluding the PMAMs and MEDCOs\n•\nTo enable and provide all stakeholders with the requisite skill and knowledge related\ntrainings to enhance their capacities to perform their role effectively and efficiently\n•\nTo ensure that the skills and knowledge of the stakeholders is maintained by using\nappropriate methods and tools\n\nIt is anticipated that a newly empanelled facility/ a new stakeholder in the ecosystem would\nrequire a thorough understanding and relevant upskilling on the multiple facets of the scheme.\nFor e.g., a PMAM should understand the themes like BIS, TMS, IEC, Portability, etc.\n\nHow EHCPs can request for training\nTo ease the process of identifying the thematic area with the stakeholder, a matrix of has been\nprepared. It is advised that the empanelled healthcare providers:\n•\nRaise/ request and recommend training requirement to the district implementation units\n•\nAttend the training programmes organized by NHA / SHA / its partners\n•\nNominate and ensure PMAM/ MEDCOs attend training programm\n•\nProvide feedback on the trainings attended\n•\nUpdate developments and changes in the programme by thoroughly going though\nreference materials shared by NHA / SHA\n•\nConduct in-house orientation / training for other personnel in the facility\n•\nDevelop internal systems for knowledge transfer and learning to manage staff attritions\n\nRecently, to streamline the process of training, a cascade model has been adopted. This model\nallows creation of layers of trainers at all levels (National, State/ Regional and District level) with\ndefined responsibilities. While the training requirements are adequately met by the region/ state/\ndistrict, training requests may also be raised at the national level through the appropriate\nchannel. It should be noted that NHA reviews these requests and addresses the same as per\nthe guidelines.\n\nNational Health Authority (NHA) has also developed Arogya Shiksha, an online learning\nmanagement platform to address the capacity building needs of the scheme. The learning\nmaterials (videos, presentations and other courses) can be accessed from learn.pmjay.gov.in\nand you can access it after successful registration in the portal. To access Arogya Shiksha, visit\nhttps://learn.pmjay.gov.in/home.php#. Before accessing any learning materials, participants are\nrequired to register in the NHA’s Single Sign-On system and validate their identity.\n\nIn addition to Arogya Shiksha, an E-learning course for Pradhan Mantri Arogya Mitras (PMAM)\nhas also been developed. This e-learning course is designed to provide the learner with the\nnecessary skills, knowledge and attitudes required to become a PMAM. After completing\nthis programme, participants should be able to:\n\n Prepare for help desk operations\n Provide relevant AB PM-JAY information to beneficiaries\n Check eligibility and verify patients/beneficiaries for AB PM-JAY\n Submit registration, pre-authorization and claims requests and facilitate service\n Use computers, electronic and related equipment for carrying out various work activities\n Maintain interpersonal relationships with patients, colleagues, and others"}

Information Education Communication (IEC)\n\nInformation, Education and Communication, abbreviated as IEC, is a strategy to spread\nawareness through communication channels to a target audience to achieve a desired positive\nresult. The main objective of the IEC division is to generate awareness about the scheme\nthrough the dissemination of information aimed at building brand resilience, beneficiary\nsensitization including empowerment and thus support the implementation process to ensure\noptimum results.

Quality Assurance\n\nWith the increase in the number of empanelled hospitals, it is critical to define a quality\nframework based on the basic principles of patient safety, to monitor and measure, adverse\nevents and take corrective and preventive measures as and when required.\n\nIt is envisaged that the process of quality certification will ensure that the hospitals demonstrate\ncommitment towards quality care and raising the bar for other network hospitals to follow. It also\nhelps them to create a distinct representation and boost the confidence of beneficiaries in the\nservices being provided under the AB PM-JAY scheme.\n\nObjectives of Quality under PM- JAY\n•\nProviding 'Quality healthcare' to beneficiaries is the prime motto of the scheme.\n•\nEnsuring transparency in the care provided to the patient and reducing fraudulent cases.\n•\nBuild a network of healthcare providers delivering quality clinical & support services while\nfollowing the healthcare protocols.\n•\nRaise awareness about quality care and establish a quality system in all empanelled\nhospitals.\n\nThe quality framework and initiatives for the AB PM-JAY scheme include the following:\n\n Quality Monthly Audit Checklist: It is a self-assessment evidence-based checklist\nconsisting of 20 parameters. A method of self-assessment includes – direct observation,\npatient interview, staff interview and record review as per parameter. It may be noted that\nempanelled hospitals have to perform an online assessment every month and the average\nscore is considered as the yearly assessment score.\n\n Trigger Based Quality Audit: Trigger Based Quality Audits is an audit framework based\non triggers and algorithms which can be utilized to closely monitor and track quality health\ncare delivery in PM-JAY EHCPs. Trigger Based Quality Audits provide a framework to\nimprove the quality of patient care collaboratively and systematically. It reveals the need for\nimprovements to service.\n\nIn addition to the above, a 3-level hospital quality certification process has been established for\nAB PM-JAY. The levels differ in terms of their certification criteria, financial incentivization, and\nprovides leverage to the empanelled hospitals that are already certified by nationally or\ninternationally recognized accreditation body (NQAS, NABH & JCI). NABH’s Entry-Level/ NQAS\ncertified hospitals can apply directly for AB PMJAY Silver quality certification and hospitals with"}
{"page": 17, "text": "17 | P a g e\n\nNABH’s Full Accreditation/JCI accreditation can apply for AB PMJAY Gold quality certification\ndirectly. Hospitals which are not certified by any accreditation body need to apply for bronze\ncertificate in order to get the quality certification. After completion of six months from the date of\nreceiving the certificate, hospitals can also upgrade to Silver and later to Gold. Also, a Guideline\non the step-wise process for non-empanelled hospitals for AB PM-JAY Quality certificate is\ndeveloped by NHA to promote quality certification in hospitals.\n\nFor further details regarding the guidelines and process, please visit the website on the link,\nhttps://pmjay.gov.in/resources/documents and refer to the Hospital Empanelment & Quality\nAssurance section for AB PM-JAY Quality guidelines\nAB PM-JAY Quality certification portal: https://pmjay.qcin.org/Index\n\n6.

Such payments will be released after processing of claims by Claim Executive\n(CEX) subject to fulfilment of following criteria by the hospital:\n•\nThe EHCP should not have any suspicious cases/confirmed fraud/disciplinary action\npending or taken/should not have high Risk Score.\n•\nIf any EHCP is found to be indulged in any fraudulent practice in current and immediate\nprevious financial year, it will make the hospital ineligible for the green channel.\n•\nThe EHCP should have been empanelled for at least 6 months under the scheme.\n•\nClaim has been processed and approved by CEX.\n•\nHospitals must furnish a bank guarantee equivalent to the amount that they would like to\nreceive under green channel against partially processed claims.\n•\nA green channel account will be created in TMS for the EHCPs that meet all necessary\nconditions. The total amount of reimbursement under GCP at any point of time cannot\nexceed the value of bank guarantee submitted by the concerned EHCP. The credit available\nin the account will be reduced by the claim amount paid under GCP. Once such claims are\nprocessed, the account will be auto credited back with the value of amount released under\nGCP.\nFor e.g., suppose a claim amount of Rs 1,00,000 was processed under GCP and Rs. 50,000\nwas released to the EHCP. The EHCP has deposited a BG of Rs. 10,00,000. After release of\nRs. 50,000, hospital is left with the green channel credit of Rs 9,50,000. Once the claim is\nprocessed and approved. The green channel credit of the hospital will be restored to Rs.\n10,00,000. This will be a recurring process.\n•\nAt the time of release of funds, the following is mandatory:\n- At least 10 days of validity of the bank guarantee furnished by the EHCP should be\nremaining\n- The claim amount proposed to be partially released under GCP is lower than the balance\nleft in the green channel account of the EHCP (The amount related to EHCP as part of\nthe full settlement of claims will not be considered as funds released under GCP)\n•\nThe EHCP should consent to submit standard documents for claim submission for the faster\nclaim processing.\n•\nThe EHCP shall furnish an Undertaking to comply with the demand for recovery, if any, that\nmay arise later. This must be uploaded on the HEM portal.\n\nIMPACT Portal\n\nThe portal has been created by NHA for monitoring & evaluating the performance of\nInsurers/ISAs/TPAs engaged by SHAs including compliance to contractual obligations.

National Anti-Fraud Unit (NAFU) has been created at\nNHA for overall monitoring and implementation of anti-fraud framework supported by State\nAnti-Fraud Units (SAFU) at the state level.\n\nAnti-Fraud Framework covers the entire gamut of activities for prevention, detection, and\ndeterrence of different kinds of fraud that could occur in AB PM-JAY at different stages of its\nimplementation by any entity involved in the implementation of the scheme.\n\nProcess of Fraud Control System\n\nFor further details regarding the guidelines and process, please visit the website on the link,\nhttps://pmjay.gov.in/resources/documents and refer to for Fraud and Abuse"}
{"page": 30, "text": "30 | P a g e\n\n12.3 Monitoring and Research (M&R)\n\nMonitoring & Research is imperative for the successful implementation of such a large-scale\ninsurance scheme. The M&R department provides continuous updates on the process and\noutput indicators through a strong real-time, interactive Management Information System (MIS).\nIt streamlines the knowledge from the products developed during the process of implementation\nand disseminates it to the concerned staff as and when required. The department undertakes\nresearch activities and institutionalizes working papers, policy briefs while also engaging with\nexternal agencies for research studies. Streamlining of research activities, conducting TAC\n(Technical Advisory Committee) meetings for upcoming research studies and maintaining a\nrepository of required datasets are some other areas where M&R is involved.\n\nM&R Division supports in policy making at national & state level by sharing the performance\ndata of EHCPs and States as well. The performance of EHCPs are being captured on insight\ndata in real time basis and serves as a tool for review and further development of strategies.\n\nVI. Conclusion\n\nEmpaneled Healthcare Providers (EHCPs) are eminent part of the scheme and one of the\nunique features of the Ayushman Bharat PM-JAY wherein Government has engaged private\nsector healthcare providers for extending the coverage of the scheme and provide treatment to\neligible AB PM-JAY beneficiaries. National Health Authority acknowledges the efforts and\ncontributions made by EHCPs associated with us across India.\n\nNHA also acknowledge the need to provide required handholding support to EHCPs so that\nthey can perform well under the scheme and extend all possible support to poor and vulnerable\npopulation eligible under the scheme. EHCPs must refer the related chapters to get information\nabout hospital empanelment, quality accreditation of EHCPs, beneficiary registration, treatment,\nclaim processing, information education and communication (IEC), grievance redressal and\nfraud control. The operational manual on AB PM-JAY aims to develop the capacity of existing\nHR at all level to create the better understanding and improving the functionality of the hospitals\nunder AB PM- JAY. Weblink of relevant AB PM-JAY guidelines and documents have been duly\nmentioned in the Manual for ready reference by EHCPs.\n\nThe manual will act as a ready reckoner to guide and facilitate empanelled hospitals so that they\ncould streamline their process and adopt the existing guidelines of AB PM-JAY as amended by\nNHA/SHA from time to time as available on PM-JAY website. Hospitals must review their\nphysical and financial performance periodically to develop evidence-based strategies for better\nparticipation. For any kind of support hospitals shall approach the District Implementation units\nof their catchment area, SHA and /or NHA using helpline number 14555. In addition, the scheme\nalso provides a platform for beneficiary, hospitals as well as other stake holders to raise their\ngrievance by using weblink https://cgrms.pmjay.gov.in, enabling NHA/SHA for timely resolution\nof grievance."}

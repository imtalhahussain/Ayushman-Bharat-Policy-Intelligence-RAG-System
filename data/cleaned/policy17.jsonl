{"page": 1, "text": "PREFACE\nRecognizing the importance of increasing access by all to critical health\nservices for achieving universal health coverage, the honourable Prime\nMinister of India announced the Pradhan Mantri Rashtriya Swasthya\nSuraksha Mission (PMRSSM). This is a key pillar of the comprehensive\nhealth care vision of the Government of India.\nThis ambitious initiative covers the health care costs of up to five lakh\nrupees for 10 crore households, thereby protecting them from\nimpoverishment due to health-related expenses, and allows them to\nchoose between public and private providers for any hospitalisation.\nThe PMRSSM aims to provide the poorest households with equitable\naccess to a comprehensive package of patient-centred quality services.\nThe evidence-informed development of comprehensive service packages\nis an important step towards this goal.\nAt the same time, to build an effective and accountable network of\nproviders, a set of minimum criteria has been developed, based on which\nhospitals will be empanelled. In addition, performance-linked payment\nsystem has been designed to incentivize them to continuously improve\nquality and patient safety, based on successive milestones. Hospitals\nqualifying for NABH entry-level accreditation will receive an additional\n10%, while those qualifying for full accreditation will receive an additional\n15%. To promote equity in access, hospitals providing services in\naspirational districts will receive an additional 10%. In addition, States\nhave the flexibility to increase rates up to 10 % or reduce them as much\nas needed to suit local market conditions. Further States could retain their\nexisting package rates, even if they are higher than the prescribed 10 %\nflexibility slab.\nI am grateful to all the stakeholders who engaged in the consultation\nprocess and provided valuable suggestions in finalising the benefit\npackages and empanelment criteria. We intend to continuously refine the\ndesign of the scheme based on experience in implementation.\n\nDr. Indu Bhushan\nChief Executive Officer,\nPradhan Mantri Rashtriya Swasthya Suraksha Mission (PMRSSM)\nGovernment of India\n05 June 2018"}
{"page": 2, "text": "PROVIDER NETWORK UNDER PM-RSSM\nEmpanelment & Allied Process\nI.\nBackground\nAt the heart of the Pradhan Mantri Rashtriya Swasthya Suraksha Mission (PMRSSM) it is\nenvisaged that the health services delivered to its beneficiaries are safe and of appropriate\nquality for realizing patient centric care. All activities working towards this should\nstrengthen and reinforce the primacy of an effective provider network, and its\naccountability towards the beneficiaries of the scheme. Empanelment is one such key\naspect which while balancing adequate access would also ensure appropriate patient safety\nand quality.\nManaging performance and strengthening accountability in the delivery of quality health\ncare in Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY) through empanelled hospitals was one of the\nkey themes that emerged for attention during RSBY’s implementation. Currently under\nRSBY, hospitals can be empanelled if they fulfil a minimum set of criteria related to\ninfrastructure1, and in districts with lesser availability of hospitals; some further relaxation\nin the criteria is also practised. Existing structural criteria are inadequate to ensure patient\nsafety, and since there is no applicable quality improvement process, these are areas where\nPMRSSM needs to build beyond what could be achieved in RSBY and other state programs.\nWith PMRSSM expanding to cover tertiary care benefits, strengthening the empanelment\ncriteria will be of paramount importance to address issues related to quality. Patient safety\nand appropriateness of care should be the core principles around which the PMRSSM\nempanelment process is created in order to drive genuine improvements in care delivery\nand eventually for improved health outcomes for PMRSSM beneficiaries.\nII.\nApproach\n1. As part of the wider committee to decide the health entitlements for PMRSSM, it\nwas also decided to finalize the qualification criteria and the allied process involved\nviz. process for empanelment & de-empanelment, quality improvement efforts etc.\ntowards establishing a comprehensive service delivery network for the scheme.\n2. As a first step existing practices of government run health insurance programmes\nacross Central ministries and States were studied including the empanelment\nprocess involved (a comparative analysis is annexed on the same).\n3. The criteria established under the Clinical establishment Act2, was used as a guiding\nexample to establish structural & human resource requirements for specialities\nbased on the intensity of care required.\n4. State consultations were held with practitioners of similar programmes, inviting\nviews based on experience and sharing evidence.\n\n1 Structural and HR requirements\n2 The Clinical Establishments Act was passed by the GoI, to provide for registration and regulation of all clinical\nestablishments in the country with a view to prescribing the minimum standards of facilities and services\nwhich may be provided by them so that mandate of article 47 of the constitution for improvement in public\nhealth may be achieved."}
{"page": 3, "text": "5. Speciality-wise sub-groups assigned to design packages reviewed the corresponding\nminimum qualification criteria for such specialities.\nIII.\nMandate\ni.\nTo establish detailed empanelment criteria & accompanying mechanics for providers\nto be empanelled into the PMRSSM provider network.\nii.\nTo define functional requirement specification for provider empanelment process\nalong with a detailed process flow on the same.\niii.\nTo provide detailed pro forma for capturing details of providers on the online web-\ninterface envisaged for PMRSSM.\nIV.\nMechanics envisaged for PMRSSM\nSimilar to its predecessor (RSBY), the health care services under PMRSSM would be\nprovided to its beneficiaries through a network of public and private healthcare providers.\nIn view of the above, the following broad guidelines have been suggested towards\nempanelment of hospitals under the program, with a view to improving quality processes\nand health care services in PMRSSM network hospitals.\n1. All establishments with indoor admission facility are eligible to be empanelled\nunder PMRSSM, provided they can meet the requirements highlighted below.\n2. Both Public and Private healthcare providers which provide hospitalization and/or\nday care services would be eligible for empanelment under PMRSSM, subject to their\nmeeting of certain requirements in the areas of infrastructure, manpower,\nequipment (IT, help desk etc.) and services (for e.g. liaison officers to facilitate\nbeneficiary management) offered.\ni.\nIt is suggested to empanel all public facilities (including ESI) with capability\nof providing inpatient services (Community Health Centre level and above) to\ncontribute actively under PMRSSM.\nii.\nFor private providers a tiered approach to empanelment will be followed.\nEmpanelment criteria are proposed to be prepared for various types of\nservices.\n\n• For all PMRSSM network Hospitals\n• Hospitals would need to meet these essential criteria to provide services under\nPMRSSM.\nCategory 1: Essential criteria\n• Hospitals would need to be empanelled separately for certain service packages\n(bundled) authorized for one or more specialties (for e.g. Cardiology, Polytrauma,\nOncology, Neurosurgery etc.) over and above the essential criteria to be able to\nprovide services beloging to such specialty procedures.\nCategory 2: Advanced criteria"}
{"page": 4, "text": "These requirements would largely be consistent with the criteria as laid down in the\nClinical Establishment Act and the experience of state government health protection\nprograms, adapted to the service delivery model envisaged for PMRSSM. Indicative\nempanelment criteria have been annexed.\n3. The ownership of the hospital network would shift to the PMRSSM rather than any\nintermediaries, so that key decisions on empanelment and dis-empanelment are\ntaken by NHA/ SHA3, and the network would continue independent of any change in\nintermediary.\ni.\nA web based application process for empanelment will be developed, backed\nby an institutional mechanism to review eligibility for empanelment and to\nundertake any required process for disciplinary action or dis-empanelment -\nan online, nation-wide interface for hospitals with PMRSSM.\nii.\nAn indicative process for empanelment and de-empanelment of hospitals\nunder PMRSSM is provided in the next section.\n4. State Governments will have the flexibility4 to revise the empanelment criteria\nbased on their local context, availability of providers, and the need to balance quality\nand access. NHA would closely monitor and follow-up the experience of states as\nmeans to guide them and revise the empanelment guidelines from time to time.\n5. Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) efforts are planned to be undertaken in\nPMRSSM network hospitals, so as to ensure that appropriate and consistent quality\nservices are delivered to the beneficiary, to improve the permanency, safety and\nwell-being of beneficiary in care; to reduce the possibility of adverse occurrences\nand to maintain a system for continuous quality improvement with regard to patient\ncentred outcomes.\ni.\nThe continuous quality improvement will be implemented as a nationwide\nquality assurance and improvement programme and will support\nopportunities for continuous learning. Networked hospitals will also be\nexpected to submit reports on defined quality indicators, as part of the CQI\nprogram.\nii.\nHospitals will be encouraged to attain quality milestones through\nincentivised payment structures. In line with similar incentives available in\nprograms run by Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra etc. and also\nin CGHS, it is suggested that providers could be incentivized for higher\npackage rates in a staged approach as means to promote quality and patient\nsafety (for e.g. similar to the approach available under NABH).\niii.\nFurther as means to improve access and ensure equity in provider coverage,\nhospitals in aspirational districts may be incentivized an additional 10 %.\niv.\nIndicative incentive mechanisms are as below (this would be a voluntary\nexercise at the state’s discretion, with prior intimation to NHA).\n\n3 National Health Authority’ (NHA), will be the implementing body to oversee, coordinate and steer PMRSSM.\nState Health Authority (SHA) would be the state level equivalent body towards the scheme’s implementation.\n4 States to intimate such special considerations to NHA."}

Beyond increasing motivation through better-aligned incentives, a\nwell-designed and carefully implemented CQI program has the potential to\ncatalyse changes that has an impact on the general health system.\nV.\nProcess for CQI, empanelment and de-empanelment of Hospitals\na) It is prescribed to form an Empanelment Advisory and Disciplinary Committee\n(EADC) by the State Nodal Agency to empanel and regulate the functioning of the\nnetwork hospitals under PMRSSM for their respective States (suggestive\ncomposition of EADC shall be communicated in detail in the guidelines)\nb) The EADC would need to oversee the review process on each potential network\nprovider to determine if the provider meets the minimum criteria.\nc) The selection and empanelment of network hospitals would be based on an online\napplication. Based on the material information/ disclosures provided by the Hospital\nin their application, subsequent verification/ audit (an extensive review comprising\nof a back-end screening process of documentation at the State level (EADC) and an\non-site inspection at the respective district-level) would be conducted by the SHA/\nTrust state representative or implementation support agency authorized by it.\nd) The ascertainment of the empanelment criteria may be carried out by committee\ncomprising of District CMO, Senior officer nominated by the District\nMagistrate/Collector, representative from Insurance Company and a nominee of\nSHA. The District team and Insurance team can carry out parallel and independent\nvisits and\ni.\nVerify whether the hospital exist or not\nii.\nWhether the hospital is really run by allopathic doctors and validate speciality\nbased/ services for which the hospital has applied.

Mere existence of specialist services does not mean that all level of\nprocedures and all level of complexities can be undertaken.

It is prescribed that\nthe empanelment of an Empanelled Health Care Provider would continue for a\nperiod of 3 years from the date of empanelment after which the provider would\nneed to undergo a re-empanelment process. It is further suggested that the State\nnodal agency/ EADC would need to conduct a full re-credentialing review of health\ncare providers after a 3 year period to ensure all providers meet the credentialing\nrequirements (hospitals with continuous NABH certification may be exempted).\nf) Providers would not be allowed to be choose the specialities for which they could\ncater to. Rather based on the degree of qualification credentials full-filled by a\nprovider, specialties to which they could cater to would be assigned by the EADC.\ng) Generating automated reports and reviewing them on a monthly/ quarterly basis by\nthe SHA for every catchment area covered based on utilization data, health quality\nindicators etc. for assessment of the provider performance is prescribed.\ni.\nRandom Hospital and Beneficiary Visits combined with Medical audits linked\nto triggers (patterns based on claims data, grievances registered (for e.g.\nmedical malpractice or informal payments), frequency and gaps in uploading\ndata etc.) need to be undertaken on random sample basis to ensure\ncompliance to guidelines and medical appropriateness of care (to be decided\nby PMRSSM from time to time).\nii.\nA list of potential triggers for identifying provider related fraud will be\ndeveloped by the NHA and communicated to States in due course.\niii.\nMechanisms for strong and immediate action against errant stakeholders\n(suspension/ de-empanelment) with widespread visibility to these efforts\nwould be established for deterrence against fraudulent behaviour.\n1. De-empanelment/ Blocking of Hospitals for fraudulent behaviour to\nhave stringent penalizations – adopting a scoring system approach\nwith blacklisting for 2/3 years (as a final step)\n2. EADC to also have the provision of levying monetary penalties on a\ncase to case basis as means to balance geographical coverage (an\nindicative matrix would be shared with states in due course). There\nwould also be a provision of appeals up to a time limit of 15 days.\n3. Temporary withdrawal by providers from PMRSSM can only re-enter/\nre-empanel into the programme after a period of 6 months. Provision\nto handle on a case-case basis to determine the re-entry period would\nvest with the EADC as means to balance geographical coverage.\n4.

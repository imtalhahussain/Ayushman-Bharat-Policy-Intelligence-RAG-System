Introduction of AB PM-JAY\n\nAyushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB PM-JAY) is the world’s largest health\nassurance scheme fully financed by the government. It is the flagship scheme of the\nGovernment of India, launched on 23rd Sep 2018, to achieve the vision of Universal Health\nCoverage (UHC). The scheme possesses the potential to bring a paradigm shift in the\nhealthcare sector of the nation and aims at reducing the financial burden on poor and vulnerable\ngroups arising out of catastrophic hospital episodes.\n\nThe scheme aims to create a system of healthcare facilities that meet the immediate\nhospitalization needs of the eligible beneficiary family in a cashless manner thus insulating the\nfamily from the associated financial crisis.\n\nThree years further on, the scheme has empanelled ~26,000 private & public hospitals which\ninclude a wide array of facilities. Even though, the primary responsibility of healthcare providers\nis to provide treatment to patients, services to PM-JAY beneficiaries must be provided in\nalignment with the contours of the scheme and in compliance with PM-JAY’s fundamental\nprinciples, policy and practice.\n\nFor hospitals empanelment, the empanelment committees at the national, state and district\nlevels have defined a set of guidelines to be followed and requirements that need to be fulfilled\nfor the empanelment process. Once empanelled, the hospitals (also referred as Empanelled\nHealthcare Providers) are provided with required handholding support regarding Information\nTechnology (IT) systems, training, Information Education and Communication (IEC), health\nbenefit packages, quality, etc.\n\nThe scheme has many unique features, some of which are illustrated below:"}

Purpose of Hospital Operations Manual\n\nAyushman Bharat- Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB PM-JAY) is a nationwide health\nassurance scheme with a focus on providing coverage to about 10.74 crore families that form\nthe vulnerable population group. The scheme not only takes pride in being a major step in\nmoving towards Universal Health Coverage (UHC). The key to the success of the scheme has\nbeen the public and private sector working hand in hand to provide better healthcare services\nto the beneficiaries. As of November 2021, the scheme has a network of around 25,881\nempaneled public and private hospitals across 36 States and Union Territories of India. This\nnetwork of hospitals has proven to be pivotal in the successful implementation of the scheme.\n\nSince inception of the scheme, it has been our experience that hospitals that intent to join the\nscheme and those that are a part of the network, undergo several changes and in the process,\nface varied challenges. As per the guidelines, hospitals need to fulfill a certain criterion to be\nable to initiate the process of empanelment. Thereafter, the hospitals also need to maintain a\nminimum standard of requirements of human resource, hardware, training, awareness (IEC),\netc. to be able to maintain the requisite quality of care.\n\nSince this increasing network of hospitals requires continuous support, the National Health\nAuthority has developed this document, ‘Operations Manual for EHCPs’ that would serve as a\nguidebook for the empaneled hospitals. This manual would be a one-stop reference for the\nEHCPs to access the guidelines and SOPs and facilitate them in streamlining their processes\nwith respect to the functioning of the scheme. With the aim of providing a detailed understanding\nof the not just the systems across the scheme, this comprehensive document also offers an\ninsight into the organization structure at NHA as well as defines the role of each vertical and the\nrespective guidelines laid down for the hospitals. The reader may access the resource material\nthrough the links provided in the different sections of the document.\n\nNHA had also developed a brief guideline on “Streamlining Systems & Processes at Hospitals\nfor AB-PMJAY” that provides information about required eligibility criteria prior to empanelment,\nprovisions to procure necessary hardware, recruitment of Arogya Mitras for service delivery,\ncapacity building, kiosk setup, IEC, process of raising pre-auth & using TMS, setting up of corpus\nfund, procurement of medicines, diagnostics & investigation process etc. The guidelines on\n“Streamlining Systems & Processes at Hospitals for AB-PMJAY” for reference are available on\nAB PM-JAY website using following link: https://pmjay.gov.in/resources/documents.\n\nThe Operational Manual is a comprehensive and updated guideline based on recent\nimprovement in the AB PM-JAY system and processes and aims to provide a thorough\nunderstanding of the proposed process, and other related activities for the improved\nengagements of EHCPs. Additionally, information about do’s and don’ts for EHCPs has also\nbeen mentioned as annexure-1 that may be used for reference."}

Benefits for EHCPs under AB PM-JAY\n\nBecause of the scale of coverage of the scheme, Ayushman Bharat (AB PM-JAY) is a unique\nprogramme owing to the numerous stakeholders involved. The scheme offers several\nadvantages to the key stakeholders of the scheme, i.e., beneficiaries, service providers, SHAs,\nTPA & insurance agencies. AB PM-JAY is one of the schemes that promotes participation of\nprivate hospitals in Government scheme similar to public hospitals. Some of the unique aspects\nof the scheme are mentioned below:\n\nIncentives for Hospitals: Hospitals will receive incentives over and above basic package rates.\nThe hospitals with better quality standards will be rewarded for the same based on the incentive\nmechanisms shown below. However, the given incentive structure is indicative and might vary\nacross states:\n\nS. No\nCriteria\nIncentive*\nAB PM-JAY Bronze Quality certification\n5%\nNational Level NQAS Certified EHCPs”\n15%\nEntry Level NABH\n10%\nFull NABH accreditation\n15%\nSituated in Metro City#\n10%\nAspirational District$\n10%\nRunning PG/DNB course in the empanelled specialities\n10%\n*Incentive structure is indicative and may vary across States.\n#Metro cities include Delhi (Including Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Noida, Gurugram), Greater Mumbai,\nKolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad and Pune\n$ as per the listed districts by NITI Aayog\n“NQAS incentive will be applicable from 1st April, 2022\n\nLarge Patient base: Ayushman Bharat PM-JAY is the largest health assurance scheme in the\nworld which aims at providing a health cover of Rs. 5 lakhs per family per year for secondary\nand tertiary care hospitalization across public and private empanelled hospitals in India to over\n10.74 crores poor and vulnerable families (approximately 50 crore beneficiaries) that form the\nbottom 40% of the Indian population. The scheme provides a large patient base to hospitals and\nhelps them to fill their unfilled/unoccupied beds. Hospitals may achieve higher revenue without\nspending additional fixed costs on the infrastructure.\n\nPortability: NHA has the provision of providing treatment to AB PM-JAY beneficiaries from\nother states under portability norms that will increase the beneficiary base for empaneled\nhealthcare providers. This feature dissipates state boundaries and will allows patients to access\nEHCPs which provides quality services from across the country and not just their state.\n\nEase of Doing Business for EHCPs:\n•\nTimebound Reimbursement Process: The scheme ensures timely payment of claim\namount within specified TAT (turnaround time). The EHCPs are expected to upload all\nclaim-related documents within 24 hours of discharge of the beneficiary. Further, EHCPs\ncan refer claim adjudication guidelines as amended by NHA/SHA from time to time.\n•\nGrievance Redressal: Any issue faced by the hospitals may be escalated through the\ngrievance redressal system under AB PM-JAY. Hospitals can register grievances\nthrough the portal.\n•\nOnline Transparent System: All EHCPs make use of the IT system to manage the\nclaims-related transactions. IT system has been developed for online transactions and\nall stakeholders are advised to maintain online transactions preferably to ensure the\nclaim reporting in real-time."}

Empanelment is one such key aspect which while balancing adequate access would\nalso ensure appropriate patient safety and quality.\n\nCriteria for Empanelment for EHCPs\nConsidering the supply side characteristics, two types of empanelment criteria have been\nevolved.\n\n General criteria – For hospitals that provide non-specialised general medical and surgical\ncare with or without ICU and emergency services.\n\n Speciality criteria (for clinical specialities) – For each speciality, a specific set of criteria\nhas been identified. Under PM-JAY, a hospital is not allowed to select the risk, which means\nit cannot apply for selected specialities and must agree to offer all specialities to PM-JAY\nbeneficiaries that are offered by it. However, to offer a specialised clinical service, the\nhospital must have necessary specific infrastructure and HR in place as mentioned in the\nspecial criteria developed under PM-JAY for the same.\n\nFor further details regarding the guidelines and process, please visit the website on the link,\nhttps://pmjay.gov.in/resources/documents\nand\nrefer\nto\nthe\nHospital\nnetwork\n&\nEmpanelment and Quality Assurance\nLink for HEM portal\nhttps://hospitals.pmjay.gov.in/empApplicationHome.htm?actionVal=loginPage\n\n2. Hospital Empanelment Module (HEM)\n\nA web-based platform Hospital Empanelment Module (HEM) has been developed for\nregistration of a healthcare provider willing to get empanelled under the flagship program\nAB PM-JAY. Every hospital needs to visit the web portal and create an account for themselves\nand must show a willingness to empanel itself. The system allows registering the hospital, after\nthe hospital's consent for empanelment. Further, HEM creates an account with an exclusive\nhospital reference number and password. Using these credentials, the hospital has to login into\nthe system to start filling the application form with the following sections:\n\nUser section\nCivil infrastructure\nHospital basic information\nMedical infrastructure\nFinancial details\nGeneral services\nSpecialities offered\nMan-power details\nLicenses and certifications\n\nFurther, HEM portal will be helpful for the EHCPs in case they need to update (change of contact\ndetails, change in specialities etc.) on the aforesaid information after empanelment by using\nHEM login credentials.\n\nSubsequent to empanelment, hospital needs basic infrastructure, manpower, training, capacity\nbuilding on various aspects of AB PM-JAY, engagement with ISA/TPA/Insurance agencies,\ncoordination with district/state/national authorities of AB PM-JAY, IEC, M&R etc. The chapters\nindicated herein will discuss the support extended to EHCPs at various level considering\nhospital’s journey under AB PM-JAY."}

Capacity Building\n\nSince, AB PM-JAY is one of the largest health insurance scheme, it requires efficient utilization\nof resources across all levels, i.e. healthcare providers, insurance companies, development\nagencies, others. To achieve the noble objectives of the scheme, capacity building forms an\nintegral part of the system and has the following objectives:\n•\nTo define structures and systems with specific roles for all stakeholders in PM-JAY\nincluding the PMAMs and MEDCOs\n•\nTo enable and provide all stakeholders with the requisite skill and knowledge related\ntrainings to enhance their capacities to perform their role effectively and efficiently\n•\nTo ensure that the skills and knowledge of the stakeholders is maintained by using\nappropriate methods and tools\n\nIt is anticipated that a newly empanelled facility/ a new stakeholder in the ecosystem would\nrequire a thorough understanding and relevant upskilling on the multiple facets of the scheme.\nFor e.g., a PMAM should understand the themes like BIS, TMS, IEC, Portability, etc.\n\nHow EHCPs can request for training\nTo ease the process of identifying the thematic area with the stakeholder, a matrix of has been\nprepared. It is advised that the empanelled healthcare providers:\n•\nRaise/ request and recommend training requirement to the district implementation units\n•\nAttend the training programmes organized by NHA / SHA / its partners\n•\nNominate and ensure PMAM/ MEDCOs attend training programm\n•\nProvide feedback on the trainings attended\n•\nUpdate developments and changes in the programme by thoroughly going though\nreference materials shared by NHA / SHA\n•\nConduct in-house orientation / training for other personnel in the facility\n•\nDevelop internal systems for knowledge transfer and learning to manage staff attritions\n\nRecently, to streamline the process of training, a cascade model has been adopted. This model\nallows creation of layers of trainers at all levels (National, State/ Regional and District level) with\ndefined responsibilities. While the training requirements are adequately met by the region/ state/\ndistrict, training requests may also be raised at the national level through the appropriate\nchannel. It should be noted that NHA reviews these requests and addresses the same as per\nthe guidelines.\n\nNational Health Authority (NHA) has also developed Arogya Shiksha, an online learning\nmanagement platform to address the capacity building needs of the scheme.

Quality Assurance\n\nWith the increase in the number of empanelled hospitals, it is critical to define a quality\nframework based on the basic principles of patient safety, to monitor and measure, adverse\nevents and take corrective and preventive measures as and when required.\n\nIt is envisaged that the process of quality certification will ensure that the hospitals demonstrate\ncommitment towards quality care and raising the bar for other network hospitals to follow. It also\nhelps them to create a distinct representation and boost the confidence of beneficiaries in the\nservices being provided under the AB PM-JAY scheme.\n\nObjectives of Quality under PM- JAY\n•\nProviding 'Quality healthcare' to beneficiaries is the prime motto of the scheme.\n•\nEnsuring transparency in the care provided to the patient and reducing fraudulent cases.\n•\nBuild a network of healthcare providers delivering quality clinical & support services while\nfollowing the healthcare protocols.\n•\nRaise awareness about quality care and establish a quality system in all empanelled\nhospitals.\n\nThe quality framework and initiatives for the AB PM-JAY scheme include the following:\n\n Quality Monthly Audit Checklist: It is a self-assessment evidence-based checklist\nconsisting of 20 parameters. A method of self-assessment includes – direct observation,\npatient interview, staff interview and record review as per parameter. It may be noted that\nempanelled hospitals have to perform an online assessment every month and the average\nscore is considered as the yearly assessment score.\n\n Trigger Based Quality Audit: Trigger Based Quality Audits is an audit framework based\non triggers and algorithms which can be utilized to closely monitor and track quality health\ncare delivery in PM-JAY EHCPs. Trigger Based Quality Audits provide a framework to\nimprove the quality of patient care collaboratively and systematically. It reveals the need for\nimprovements to service.\n\nIn addition to the above, a 3-level hospital quality certification process has been established for\nAB PM-JAY. The levels differ in terms of their certification criteria, financial incentivization, and\nprovides leverage to the empanelled hospitals that are already certified by nationally or\ninternationally recognized accreditation body (NQAS, NABH & JCI). NABH’s Entry-Level/ NQAS\ncertified hospitals can apply directly for AB PMJAY Silver quality certification and hospitals with"}

Such payments will be released after processing of claims by Claim Executive\n(CEX) subject to fulfilment of following criteria by the hospital:\n•\nThe EHCP should not have any suspicious cases/confirmed fraud/disciplinary action\npending or taken/should not have high Risk Score.\n•\nIf any EHCP is found to be indulged in any fraudulent practice in current and immediate\nprevious financial year, it will make the hospital ineligible for the green channel.\n•\nThe EHCP should have been empanelled for at least 6 months under the scheme.\n•\nClaim has been processed and approved by CEX.\n•\nHospitals must furnish a bank guarantee equivalent to the amount that they would like to\nreceive under green channel against partially processed claims.\n•\nA green channel account will be created in TMS for the EHCPs that meet all necessary\nconditions. The total amount of reimbursement under GCP at any point of time cannot\nexceed the value of bank guarantee submitted by the concerned EHCP. The credit available\nin the account will be reduced by the claim amount paid under GCP. Once such claims are\nprocessed, the account will be auto credited back with the value of amount released under\nGCP.\nFor e.g., suppose a claim amount of Rs 1,00,000 was processed under GCP and Rs. 50,000\nwas released to the EHCP. The EHCP has deposited a BG of Rs. 10,00,000. After release of\nRs. 50,000, hospital is left with the green channel credit of Rs 9,50,000. Once the claim is\nprocessed and approved.

EHCPs must refer the related chapters to get information\nabout hospital empanelment, quality accreditation of EHCPs, beneficiary registration, treatment,\nclaim processing, information education and communication (IEC), grievance redressal and\nfraud control. The operational manual on AB PM-JAY aims to develop the capacity of existing\nHR at all level to create the better understanding and improving the functionality of the hospitals\nunder AB PM- JAY. Weblink of relevant AB PM-JAY guidelines and documents have been duly\nmentioned in the Manual for ready reference by EHCPs.\n\nThe manual will act as a ready reckoner to guide and facilitate empanelled hospitals so that they\ncould streamline their process and adopt the existing guidelines of AB PM-JAY as amended by\nNHA/SHA from time to time as available on PM-JAY website. Hospitals must review their\nphysical and financial performance periodically to develop evidence-based strategies for better\nparticipation. For any kind of support hospitals shall approach the District Implementation units\nof their catchment area, SHA and /or NHA using helpline number 14555.

It includes any act that may\nconstitute fraud under any applicable law in\nIndia.\n\n2.2.2\nIn addition to the above, any act (indicative list\nbelow) that is recognised by different provisions\nof the Indian Penal Code as fraud shall be\ndeemed to be fraud under the PMJAY:\n\na.

Concealment\n\n2.2.3 Human errors and waste are not included in the definition of fraud1.\n\n1 ‘Errors’ are un-intention mistakes during the process of healthcare delivery (like prescribing wrong medications\nto a patient). ‘Waste’ refers to unintentional inadvertent use of resources (prescribing high cost medicines\nwhen generic versions are available). ‘Abuse’ refers to those provider practices that are inconsistent with sound\nfiscal, business, or medical practices, and result in an unnecessary cost to the PMJAY, or in reimbursement for\nservices that are not medically necessary or that fail to meet professionally recognized standards for health care.\nIt also includes beneficiary practices that result in unnecessary cost to the PMJAY. Whereas fraud is wilful and\ndeliberate, involves financial gain, is done under false pretence and is illegal, abuse generally fails to meet one\nor more of these criteria. The main purpose of both fraud and abuse is financial and non-financial gain. Few\nexamples of common health insurance abuse would be - excessive diagnostic tests, extended length of stay and\nconversion of day procedure to overnight admission.\n\nIndian Contract Act 1972, Section 17:\n“Fraud” means and includes any of the\nfollowing acts committed by a party to a\ncontract, or with his connivance, or by his\nagent, with intent to deceive another party\nthereto of his agent, or to induce him to\nenter into the contract:\n1. the suggestion, as a fact, of that which is\nnot true, by one who does not believe it\nto be true;\n2. the active concealment of a fact by one\nhaving knowledge or belief of the fact;\n3. a promise made without any intention of\nperforming it;\n4. any other act fitted to deceive;\n5. any such act or omission as the law\nspecially declares to be fraudulent."}

This is a key pillar of the comprehensive\nhealth care vision of the Government of India.\nThis ambitious initiative covers the health care costs of up to five lakh\nrupees for 10 crore households, thereby protecting them from\nimpoverishment due to health-related expenses, and allows them to\nchoose between public and private providers for any hospitalisation.\nThe PMRSSM aims to provide the poorest households with equitable\naccess to a comprehensive package of patient-centred quality services.\nThe evidence-informed development of comprehensive service packages\nis an important step towards this goal.\nAt the same time, to build an effective and accountable network of\nproviders, a set of minimum criteria has been developed, based on which\nhospitals will be empanelled. In addition, performance-linked payment\nsystem has been designed to incentivize them to continuously improve\nquality and patient safety, based on successive milestones. Hospitals\nqualifying for NABH entry-level accreditation will receive an additional\n10%, while those qualifying for full accreditation will receive an additional\n15%. To promote equity in access, hospitals providing services in\naspirational districts will receive an additional 10%. In addition, States\nhave the flexibility to increase rates up to 10 % or reduce them as much\nas needed to suit local market conditions. Further States could retain their\nexisting package rates, even if they are higher than the prescribed 10 %\nflexibility slab.\nI am grateful to all the stakeholders who engaged in the consultation\nprocess and provided valuable suggestions in finalising the benefit\npackages and empanelment criteria. We intend to continuously refine the\ndesign of the scheme based on experience in implementation.\n\nDr. Indu Bhushan\nChief Executive Officer,\nPradhan Mantri Rashtriya Swasthya Suraksha Mission (PMRSSM)\nGovernment of India\n05 June 2018"}

All activities working towards this should\nstrengthen and reinforce the primacy of an effective provider network, and its\naccountability towards the beneficiaries of the scheme. Empanelment is one such key\naspect which while balancing adequate access would also ensure appropriate patient safety\nand quality.\nManaging performance and strengthening accountability in the delivery of quality health\ncare in Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY) through empanelled hospitals was one of the\nkey themes that emerged for attention during RSBY’s implementation. Currently under\nRSBY, hospitals can be empanelled if they fulfil a minimum set of criteria related to\ninfrastructure1, and in districts with lesser availability of hospitals; some further relaxation\nin the criteria is also practised. Existing structural criteria are inadequate to ensure patient\nsafety, and since there is no applicable quality improvement process, these are areas where\nPMRSSM needs to build beyond what could be achieved in RSBY and other state programs.\nWith PMRSSM expanding to cover tertiary care benefits, strengthening the empanelment\ncriteria will be of paramount importance to address issues related to quality. Patient safety\nand appropriateness of care should be the core principles around which the PMRSSM\nempanelment process is created in order to drive genuine improvements in care delivery\nand eventually for improved health outcomes for PMRSSM beneficiaries.\nII.\nApproach\n1. As part of the wider committee to decide the health entitlements for PMRSSM, it\nwas also decided to finalize the qualification criteria and the allied process involved\nviz. process for empanelment & de-empanelment, quality improvement efforts etc.\ntowards establishing a comprehensive service delivery network for the scheme.\n2. As a first step existing practices of government run health insurance programmes\nacross Central ministries and States were studied including the empanelment\nprocess involved (a comparative analysis is annexed on the same).\n3. The criteria established under the Clinical establishment Act2, was used as a guiding\nexample to establish structural & human resource requirements for specialities\nbased on the intensity of care required.\n4. State consultations were held with practitioners of similar programmes, inviting\nviews based on experience and sharing evidence.\n\n1 Structural and HR requirements\n2 The Clinical Establishments Act was passed by the GoI, to provide for registration and regulation of all clinical\nestablishments in the country with a view to prescribing the minimum standards of facilities and services\nwhich may be provided by them so that mandate of article 47 of the constitution for improvement in public\nhealth may be achieved."}

Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) efforts are planned to be undertaken in\nPMRSSM network hospitals, so as to ensure that appropriate and consistent quality\nservices are delivered to the beneficiary, to improve the permanency, safety and\nwell-being of beneficiary in care; to reduce the possibility of adverse occurrences\nand to maintain a system for continuous quality improvement with regard to patient\ncentred outcomes.\ni.\nThe continuous quality improvement will be implemented as a nationwide\nquality assurance and improvement programme and will support\nopportunities for continuous learning. Networked hospitals will also be\nexpected to submit reports on defined quality indicators, as part of the CQI\nprogram.\nii.\nHospitals will be encouraged to attain quality milestones through\nincentivised payment structures. In line with similar incentives available in\nprograms run by Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra etc. and also\nin CGHS, it is suggested that providers could be incentivized for higher\npackage rates in a staged approach as means to promote quality and patient\nsafety (for e.g. similar to the approach available under NABH).\niii.\nFurther as means to improve access and ensure equity in provider coverage,\nhospitals in aspirational districts may be incentivized an additional 10 %.\niv.\nIndicative incentive mechanisms are as below (this would be a voluntary\nexercise at the state’s discretion, with prior intimation to NHA).\n\n3 National Health Authority’ (NHA), will be the implementing body to oversee, coordinate and steer PMRSSM.\nState Health Authority (SHA) would be the state level equivalent body towards the scheme’s implementation.\n4 States to intimate such special considerations to NHA."}

The COVID 19 pandemic has highlighted the fact that essential public health functions\nnecessary to respond to such an outbreak were weak. Limited laboratory capacity at\nall levels meant that functions of testing, case detection, surveillance and outbreak\nmanagement were challenging and facilities for critical care provision lacked adequate\nIntensive Care Units, Isolation Beds, Oxygen supply, and Ventilators. COVID 19 also\nillustrated that despite using the health systems approach to horizontal integration\nbetween programmes, much more needs to be done to strengthen convergence between\ninstitutions created for vertical disease control programmes and the district and sub district\nservice delivery systems.\n\n1.1.2. In the early months of the pandemic, particularly in states with weak health systems there\nwas a significant decline in the delivery of non-COVID essential services, on account of\nmarshalling of all resources for COVID related activities. Health systems across the country\nwere hard put to manage the delivery of both sets of services, viz. the COVID and non-\nCOVID essential health services.\n\n1.1.3. Public health has significant externalities (food and drug regulation/, public health action,\nincluding health promotion and prevention and surveillance for infectious disease) which\nrequire government intervention. Persistent inequities in access and coverage are a barrier\nto India’s progress in health indicators and markets do not address inequities in health care.\n\n1.1.4. The on-going COVID 19 pandemic has demonstrated that India’s health systems need to\nbe better equipped to address public health needs across primary, secondary, and tertiary\ncare levels. India’s current epidemiological and demographic status, with the rapid rise\nin non- communicable diseases, a double burden of chronic and infectious diseases, and\nunfinished agenda of reproductive, maternal new-born and child health services has created\nan increasing demand on health care and public health services.\n\n1.1.5. At the same time, high costs of care, persistent health inequalities, and reduced access to\nessential public health services particularly for those living in remote areas and in slum and\nslum like areas, challenge our health system. COVID 19 and predecessor Infectious diseases\nsuch as SARS, H1N1, NIPAH and Zika outbreaks have highlighted that the health systems\nneeds to fully prepare and gear up to respond to public health emergencies."}
{"id": "221fb107-126e-47f3-8bd6-afd6f415f985", "source": "policy2", "page_start": 8, "page_end": 8, "text": "Operational Guidelines for PM Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission\n\n1.1.6. 27.5% of all deaths in India in 2016 were due to communicable diseases, maternal, neonatal\nand nutritional disorders while non-communicable diseases and injuries accounted for\n61.8% and 10.7% deaths respectively. Communicable diseases also contribute to 32.7% of\nDALYs in India (Source: India: Health of the Nation’s States, ICMR) whereas injuries contribute\nto 11.9% of DALYs in India, and 10.7% of deaths in India. It is anticipated that about 3-5% of\nemergencies would require ICU facilities and oxygen supported beds for critical care. There is\nan urgent need to strengthen these facilities and create additional amenities (infrastructure,\nequipment etc.) including for dialysis, in existing district hospitals to meet such unforeseen\nepidemics, disasters etc.\n\n1.1.7 The present architecture of the public hospitals is not equipped fully to handle the critical\nrequirement of clinical management of affected patients while maintaining essential\nservices during periods of public health challenges posed by pandemics such as the current\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Many of the hospital buildings currently available do not have the\nprovision for segregating a part of the building as an infectious diseases treatment block\\\nwing. As a result, in order to avoid mixing of COVID and non-COVID patients, at many places\nfull hospitals were required to be designated as COVID Dedicated Facilities. Apart from\nthat, at many district headquarters, especially in districts with largely rural settings, district\nhospital is the only hospital available where critical care services can be provided to people.\nAs a result, either large amounts of expenses are necessitated on account of transportation\nof patients to other districts or in case the only available hospital is designated as the COVID\n(pandemic) dedicated hospitals, there is a severe adverse impact on the other essential\nservices such as institutional deliveries, blood transfusion services, dialysis and chemotherapy\netc. Strengthening all the districts with Critical Care Hospital Blocks of 50-100 beds as per\nthe population size, will enable the public healthcare system at the district level to respond\nadequately during the public health challenges posed by future pandemics and in periods\nof epidemic outbreaks and enable the health systems to also maintain the essential health\nservices in such times. In other times when there is no epidemic, these blocks will continue\nto provide health services, especially for critical care.\n\n1.1.8. The disease burden in the country also demonstrates the need for provision of high\nquality laboratory services at district and block levels. Delays in diagnosis compromise\nearly detection and initiation of appropriate treatment. In the case of infectious disease\noutbreaks, such delays can lead to widespread community transmission.\n\n1.1.9. Both general and out of hours laboratory services (e.g. emergency services, critical care\nservices) are being provided through laboratories that are largely fragmented. Also, public\nhealth surveillance for abnormal morbidity/mortality, reporting of human or animal disease\npatterns and testing of samples etc. for public health needs remains a weak area in most\ndistricts.\n\n1.1.10. The present public healthcare system structure at the Block level is not equipped to handle\npublic health emergencies and also to respond and monitor the healthcare services. Every\nBlock in the Country is envisaged to have a Community Health Centre (CHC) at the Block\nheadquarter and serve as a hub for referral from the Sub-Health Centres (SHCs) and Primary\nHealth Centres (PHCs) within the block. However, the status of availability of CHCs across"}

In some other states, the block CHC, on the other hand, is also a First Referral Unit. The\nfunctions of a Block CHC are mostly focused on clinical services that too largely RMNCH+A\nand selected infectious diseases. The outbreak of COVID-19 has highlighted a constrained\npublic health response as a result of a suboptimal public health focus at the block level.\n\n1.1.11. The COVID-19 pandemic has also highlighted the various challenges faced in provisioning\nof trained human resources. Experience suggests that as the pandemic evolves and as the\nexperts gain a better understanding of the epidemiology and virulence of the disease,\nthe training needs also evolve. With a pandemic like COVID-19 which is a new infection,\nexperimentation in arriving at the best treatment protocol also leads to changing training\nneeds. The Ministry has set up the iGOT training platform for online training of healthcare\nprofessionals. More importantly over a period of last 5 months, the Central Institutions of\nExcellence such as the AIIMS Delhi, PGI Chandigarh etc. have assumed the much needed\nmentorship role for building confidence of the healthcare professional providing treatment\nservices to the patients, be it about personal protection, infection prevention, plasma\ntherapy, patient monitoring or about the best possible line to treatment. These institutions\nhave also acted as training sites (albeit the trainings being largely offsite!!) for the healthcare\nprofessional and for undertaking clinical studies to inform further policy direction. This\nMinistry has set up INIs like AIIMS Delhi and several other large hospitals cum teaching\ninstitutes such as Safdarjung and RML Hospital. Also, 22 new AIIMS are being established\nunder the Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY). These are tertiary healthcare,\nmedical education and research institutes. In addition, the Ministry of HRD also operates 2\nadvanced medical education and tertiary healthcare institutes/ hospitals. However, these\nhospitals have not been designed to deal with infectious disease patients. Infectious disease\nhospitals are specially designed, with negative pressure systems and other special features\nto control spread of the infectious disease.\n\n1.1.12. The complexity of COVID-19 pandemic, which has spread to over 150 Countries in the\nWorld, has highlighted the need of having competent core capacities for surveillance and\nresponse, diagnostic labs, logistics (including PPEs, Masks, Sanitizers and Disinfectants) and\nappropriate quarantine and isolation facilities at various levels. During the course of past 3-4\nmonths, the Country has faced numerous challenges like quarantine of evacuees (for China,\nIran, Italy), widespread migration, containment of complex clusters and development of\ndiagnostic capacities across the Country.\n\n1.1.13. The 40 metro cities (including Tier I and Tier II cities) presently do not have any infrastructure\nfor regular surveillance for community based health measures and health facilities.\nSimilarly, implementation of the Integrated Health Information Platform (IHIP), an IT\nenabled comprehensive surveillance platform has also only been implemented in 7 states.\nCapacities for timely data collection, collation and analytics also need strengthening.\nThe Epidemiological Intelligence Service, housed in the NCDC has been instrumental in\ncontaining recent out breaks of Nipah in Kerala and Zika in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh.\nHowever, the EIS too needs to be strengthened to have the capacity to effectively lead the\ntechnical response to pandemics of the magnitude of COVID-19."}
{"id": "0f4afa06-0dba-4dc9-b2d1-743e4e228b03", "source": "policy2", "page_start": 10, "page_end": 10, "text": "Operational Guidelines for PM Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission\n\n1.1.14. There is a need for an integrated surveillance program at all levels (Zonal and State\nlevels) and also its expansion to various metro cities. It is also envisaged that the IT level\nsurveillance network is developed, so that that there is uninterrupted data flow particularly\nsites of screening to tracking in the community and further linking it up with diagnostic\nlaboratories and isolation hospitals. The proposal encompasses strengthening of all Divisions\nof NCDC focused on applied public health and epidemiological intelligence, building\ncapacity for emerging and re-emerging infections, surveillance and its evaluation, National\nprogram for anti-microbial resistance (AMR) containment under the One health approach,\nbiosafety-biosecurity, occupational safety & climate change, and building of competencies\namong front line health care workers for strengthening community surveillance at National,\nRegional and District levels.\n\n1.1.15. A major impediment for quick response mechanism is non-availability of dedicated\nsecondary/ tertiary level medical facilities near the disaster site due to damage to the\nhealth facilities. In major public health emergencies such as COVID-19, the health system\ngets overwhelmed and there is need to deploy field hospitals. With increasing frequency of\nnatural and man-made disasters, incl. complex emergencies, a pressing need has been felt\nfor development of quick response medical clinical teams. Keeping this in mind, WHO under\nits “Global EMT (Emergency Medical Team) Initiative” calls for quality assured, accredited,\nself-sufficient in every aspect wherein, member countries deploy medical teams in another\nmember country during times of disasters, natural calamities as per the need of the host\ncountry. This also gives an opportunity for countries providing EMTs not only to strengthen\nits system to global standards but also deploy these teams for internal requirements.

Emerging infections continue to disrupt the health care system and are becoming\nincreasingly complicated to detect and treat successfully.

The Ayushman Bharat – Health and Wellness Centres (AB-HWCs), the\nflagship programme of the Government, will enable attention to community and system\nlevel primary health care interventions for preventive, promotive, curative, rehabilitative\nand palliative care. The provision of free medicines, diagnostics and access to telemedicine\nservices closer to community is expected to expand coverage and quality of primary health\ncare and reduce patient hardship and improve quality of care. Effective primary health care\ndelivery also includes undertaking public health functions through community and facility\nlevel action for surveillance, screening and early detection, vector control, etc.\n\n3.1.2 AB-HWCs offer the opportunity to ensure that girls and women would have access to care not\njust for reproductive health services, but also for the newer elements of the Comprehensive\nPrimary Health Care package including screening, diagnosis, and treatment for hypertension,\ndiabetes and mental health. Since services are provided close to community, access to\nessential services would be sustained for such sub population groups. Teleconsultation\nservices are of particular importance in reducing access barriers for women and will ensure\ngender equity. These centres will not only provide primary level clinical care services for an\nexpanded range of services as per Operational guidelines of Comprehensive Primary Health\nCare and subsequent Operational Guidelines on the expanded range of services at the centre\nbut also ensure outreach services are provided to their catchment population.\n\n3.1.3 Under the AB-HWCs programme, it is envisaged that 1,50,000 AB-HWCs shall be set up\nin the country by December 2022. Out of these, 12,500 HWCs are being setup by the\nMinistry of AYUSH as AYUSH-HWCs. As per Rural Health Statistics, 2020, as on 31st March\n2020, there are 47,518 Sub Health Centres, which are functioning in rented buildings /\npanchayat or voluntary society buildings and these SHCs require building to be constructed.\nThese infrastructure gaps of SHCs are significant especially in 7 High Focus States and"}

Support is\nprovided to the States to have Urban PHCs @50,000 per population. Outreach functions in\nthis population, are undertaken by five ANMs and 20-25 ASHAs, with a normative coverage\nof a population of 10,000 served by a team of one ANM and five ASHAs. Under Ayushman\nBharat, Urban PHCs are being strengthened as Health and Wellness Centres (UPHC-HWCs)\nto deliver Comprehensive Primary Health Care (CPHC).\n\n4.1.2 Healthcare needs and aspirations of urban residents are different from those in rural areas.\nThe current strategy of relying on outreach teams of ANM and ASHA alone to provide\nselective services is not sufficient. State experiences demonstrate that provision of health\ncare services by trained service providers from facilities closer to poorer, and vulnerable\nurban communities is likely to improve access to an expanded range of services, reduce\nOOPE, improve disease surveillance, and strengthen referral linkages. At the same time,\nstate experiences also show that the establishment of “poly clinics / provision of specialist\nservices” in selected Urban PHCs, enables reach of specialist services to poor communities,\nthus building trust in the public health system.\n\n4.1.3 Lack of a frontline health workforce in our cities has emerged as one of the biggest limiting\nfactors in our response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, a paradigm shift is envisaged\nin delivery of urban primary healthcare based on the learnings from the management\nof COVID-19 pandemic which has affected urban areas disproportionately, especially\nin metropolitan areas such as Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad,\nAhmedabad, Surat etc. A significant proportion of the urban population also constitutes\nof the migrants from other states. Also, a large proportion of these are usually settled in\ncongested urban settings. Expansion and strengthening of the grass-root primary healthcare\ndelivery institutions has thus emerged as a pressing need in the changed context. Limited\ncapacities of health systems in urban areas and the disruption in non-COVID essential health\nservices also underlines the need for provision of Universal and CPHC capacities in urban\nareas."}

In\ncase, there is no scope within the constructed area of lab, some adjoining space/ area in\nthe existing DH needs to be identified for IPHL.\n\n6.5.2 Services: Integrated District Public Laboratory (IPHL) will conduct clinical and public health\ndiagnostic tests as per Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS) under one roof. Provide support\nto routine surveillance and outbreak investigation of Infectious diseases, may perform\nenvironmental investigations (such as water culture for coliforms) and rapid diagnostic tests\nto support outbreak investigations, as and when needed.\n\n6.5.3 Most of the lab tests indicated at the IPHLs are part of IPHS. In case of any additional lab\ntests (like Microbiological analysis of water, etc.), the capacity needs to be enhanced as per\nthe vision of IPHS. Similarly, under free diagnostics, through hub and spoke models many\ndistrict labs have already been augmented and in order to improve the testing capability\nmany new equipment have also been added with support of funding from NHM. Since\ncommitment of IPHL is beyond clinical lab services, the requirements for public health\nsurveillance, infectious disease etc. also needs to be part of the system.\n\n6.5.4 In many states the diagnostic services are outsourced, and this commitment could be for\ndifferent time periods and vary in terms of the number of tests covered. While planning and\nestablishing IPHLs, focus may be laid to ensure that the population is able to benefit from\nthe extended range of services as envisaged under these guidelines.\n\n6.5.5 The flow of services in IPHL is critical for ensuring functional integration which requires the\nvarious vertical program sections to operate as the coordinated limbs of a single body – the\ndistrict public health lab, in the process sharing the space, manpower and the equipment\navoid duplication and disconnect.\n\n6.5.6 Infrastructure: The existing facility may be re-structured/re-organised, or a new facility\ncan be established (in-case enough space not available).

The country’s increasing disease burden particularly related to\nthe sequelae of chronic communicable and non-communicable diseases and injury also\nrequires access to critical care. Non-communicable diseases and injuries account for 61.8%\nand 10.7% deaths respectively. (Source: India: Health of the Nation’s States, ICMR).\n\n7.1.2 Average medical expenditure per hospitalization (both rural and urban, private and\npublic combined) is Rs. 20135/- (as per NSSO 2017-18). It is anticipated that about 3-5% of\nemergencies would require ICU facilities and oxygen supported beds for critical care. There is\nan urgent need to strengthen these facilities and create additional amenities (infrastructure,\nequipment etc.), in existing district hospitals to meet such unforeseen epidemics, disasters\netc.\n\n7.1.3 The current architecture of the public hospitals is not equipped fully to handle the dual\nburden of meeting critical care needs and maintaining essential services as was seen during\nthe two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many hospital buildings especially in districts, do\nnot have provision for segregating a part of the building as an infectious disease treatment\nblock/wing. As a result, in order to avoid mixing of COVID and non-COVID patients, entire\nhospitals were required to be designated as COVID Dedicated Facilities, thereby resulting\nin inability to provide non COVID essential services such as institutional deliveries, blood\ntransfusion services, dialysis and chemotherapy etc.\n\n7.1.4 Under PM Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission , Government of India would\nsupport 100 and 50-bedded Hospital Blocks/ Wings to augment the capacity of public health\nfacilities to provide assured critical care. These block/wings will enhance capacity to manage\npatients requiring critical care from the sequelae of infectious diseases, during pandemics,\nor are in need of critical care for any other condition, including during emergencies.\n\n7.1.5 The 100 and 50-bedded Critical Care Hospital Block/Wings would be self-contained, and be\nequipped with critical, supportive and ancillary services such as Emergency area, Intensive\nCare Units (ICU), Isolation Wards/Oxygen supported beds, Surgical unit, two labour, delivery,\nrecovery rooms (LDRs) with one New-born care corner. The capacity of support services like\nImaging facility, Dietary services, CSSD with Mechanized Laundry, etc. needs to be linked"}

So far, within two years of the scheme, 1.23 crore patients have received\ntreatment amounting to Rs 15.57 crores using these packages across 23,311 empanelled hospitals.\nHowever, since launch, the National Health Authority has been receiving feedback on various aspects\nof the scheme including the aberrations and anomalies that have crept in the HBP.

Health Benefit Packages 2.0\n2.1\nIntroduction\nIn April 2019, the Governing Board of NHA, under the Chairmanship of Hon’ble Minister for Health & Family\nWelfare, directed NHA to undertake an exercise to remove the aberrations and anomalies in the existing\nHBP. The procedure laid down was very vigorous and scientific, broadly consisting of three steps:\ni.\n24 specialty committees were formed consisting of eminent doctors from respective specialties.\nThe members of the committee were drawn from specialists working both in public and private\nsector hospitals. Examination of the relevant sections of HBP was done by respective specialist\ncommittee to make suggestions on nomenclature, inclusion, exclusion, pricing and implants used\n(if any) in the treatments to be provided under the packages. To these meetings representatives\nof IMA, FICCI, CII, NatHealth and AHPI were also invited.\nii.\nA review committee was constituted under the joint chairmanship of the CEO, NHA and Secretary,\nDHR (Department of Health Research) to examine the suggestions made by the specialist\ncommittees and moderate them if required. The committee had as its members prominent\nclinicians, representatives of NITI Aayog, Secretary Heath, Directorate General of Health Services\n(DGHS), five states and other functionaries.\niii.\nThe examination and final approval / modification of the recommendations of review committee\nwas kept in the jurisdiction of the Governing Board.\nNHA, along with Department of Health Research (DHR), Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and\nTata Memorial Hospital consulted specialist committees, which made recommendations to remove the\ninconsistencies in the nomenclature and pricing for their respective specialties. These recommendations\nwere examined by the review committee which suggested to take states’ feedback also before finalizing\nthe changes. NHA organized the ‘First National Workshop on Health Benefit Packages’ in August 2019,\ncollated all the feedbacks from various states and UTs which were examined by the review committee and\nthen the recommendations for Governing Board were finalized."}

Some of the packages are a group\nof procedures. A package is split into procedures that help better specify the approach / treatment modality\n/ etiology / complication of the package, among other criteria. Capturing of procedures in place of packages\nis expected to improve the granularity of the analysis that can be performed on the utilization data of the\nscheme.\nFor example, a package of ‘Lap/Open Cholecystectomy with / without Exploration of CBD’ is split into four\nindependent and specific procedures to be booked for a patient\ni.\nLap cholecystectomy with exploration of CBD\nii.\nLap cholecystectomy without exploration of CBD\niii.\nOpen cholecystectomy with exploration of CBD\niv.\nOpen cholecystectomy without exploration of CBD\nSignificance for the user: The list of packages are reference fields for the end user to select a procedure\nto be performed. The final selection would be at procedure level only. When searching for a procedure to\nbe performed, the TMS would sort through both the list of packages, and procedures to present the user\nwith the best match that should facilitate procedure selection and minimize chances of ambiguity."}

There may also be certain criteria that the TMS would pick up\nautomatically from patient details to distinguish between requirement of a pediatric / adult procedure, but\nthese back-end assumptions may be further vetoed by the treating physician based on his clinical\njudgment. However, such overridden assumptions may trigger a medical audit, and it is recommended that\na strong paper trail be maintained to justify such cases.\n2.2.3 Stratification in Medical Packages\nAll Medical packages in HBP 2.0 now feature as stratified packages based on the bed category of patient\nadmission. The bed category for admission and will need to be chosen at the time of selecting a diagnosis.\nThe price of medical packages will continue to be calculated based on the bed category, multiplied by the\nnumber of bed days for the patient.\nThe per day price for bed categories will be as follows:\ni.\n₹ 1,800 for Routine Ward\nii.\n₹ 2,700 for High Dependency unit\niii.\n₹ 3,600 for Intensive care not requiring ventilator support\niv.\n₹ 4,500 for Intensive care requiring ventilator support"}

The TMS will continue to calculate the final price of the medical package at the back end based\non patient bed category and number of days’ stay.\n2.2.4 Cross Specialty Packages\nThese are packages that fall under more than one specialty and would now feature under all relevant\nspecialties without duplication of the unique package code and maintaining a uniform price for the same\nprocedure across all specialties. This classification of packages as cross specialty packages at the same\nprice is expected to minimize upcoding of the same package by billing it in a different specialty.\nFor example, the package of ‘Temporary pacemaker implantation’ is a cross specialty package between\nCardiology and CTVS and will feature in both their package lists.\nSignificance for the user: It is hoped that aberrations such as duplication of packages across specialties,\nprice differential in the same package across specialties, and repetitions or ambiguities in package names\nhave been removed. While number of packages have been reduced in HBP 2.0, the number of treatment\nareas have been increased. The user would now have to go through a shorter list of packages to seek out\nthe desired procedure. The cross-specialty feature will also permit certain packages to be available across\nspecialties without unnecessarily adding on to the number of packages. For example, the procedure of\n‘Tracheostomy / Tracheotomy’ will now be available to multiple specialties at a fixed rate of ₹ 6,000\nirrespective of the specialty under which it is booked. However, it is reiterated here for the benefit of all\nhospitals and care providers that ability of booking a procedure does not automatically privilege the hospital\nto perform a procedure that it is not otherwise able, equipped, or authorized to perform.\n2.2.5 Add-on Packages\nCertain packages / procedures have been defined as add-on procedures riding on another procedure.\nThese add-on procedures may be booked in conjunction with another procedure without losing the sanctity\n/ price of the procedure. These procedures, although booked as enhancements in the TMS, will not be\ncharged at 75% of their original value.\nFor example, the package of ‘NPWT (Negative Pressure Wound Therapy)’ in Plastic Surgery is an add-on\npackage for ₹ 2,000. Booking of this package as enhancement of another plastic surgery procedure would"}

Similarly, ‘High end histopathology (Biopsies) and advanced\nserology investigations’ is an add-on package for Medical management that can be added to any current\nmedical package.\nSignificance for the user: There is no significant change at the user end on account of this feature of the\nHBP 2.0. The TMS will continue to calculate the final price of the package / packages at the back end with\nadditional considerations based on this new criterion.\n2.2.6 Standalone packages\nCertain procedures have been included in the HBP 2.0 which were consciously left out in the previous\nversion due to their potential of abuse. Similarly, a few procedures were noticed to be abused through the\nlast year of implementation of the scheme. Such procedures have been re-introduced in HBP 2.0 with\ncaution. One of the many steps taken by the NHA in this direction, is introduction of clearly defined Stand-\nalone packages which may not be claimed as enhancements to other existing / unspecified surgical\npackages. This has been done primarily to reduce the incidence of abuse of the packages yet keeping\nthem available for use.\nFor example, the package of ‘Laparoscopic adhesiolysis’ in OBG is now a standalone package and may\nnot be booked in combination with other packages.\nSignificance for the user: Packages that have been earmarked as stand-alone packages will not be\navailable to the user as enhancements to an existing / unspecified package. Such packages would be\nclearly marked in the TMS as ‘stand-alone package’.\n2.2.7 Splitting of cost of Implants / High End Consumables\nThe cost of implants and high-end consumables has been independently considered for calculation of the\npackage rate at the back end. This enables the system to vary the price of the procedure based on the\nquality / number / type of implant required in the performance of the procedure.\nFor example, package price of a ‘Balloon Pulmonary Valvotomy’ in Cardiology would vary depending on\nthe use of a pediatric / adult cardiac balloon. Price of plates / screws in orthopedics would also be calculated\nat the back end based on the number of implants used."}

However, there are significant advantages of such a splitting in the long run. Variance in the cost\nof implant will now be easily incorporated in the final calculation of the package price. Pricing will also\nbecome variable based on the number of screws / plates used in the surgery. It also adds flexibility for\naddition of different types of implants as the scheme matures. However, all the above would not feature in\nthe TMS yet. The TMS will continue to calculate the final price of the package / packages at the back end\nwith additional considerations based on this new criterion.\n2.2.8 Step payment of staged procedures\nPackages that require multiple stages for complete administration of therapy, with long gaps in between\nhave been split into stages with independent payment of each stage. This is expected to facilitate payment\nto a treating hospital, if the patient decides to continue / follow up on his / her treatment at a different facility.\nFor example, ‘Hypospadias repair - Two or more stages’ in Urology will now be paid on each, or either of\nthe following stages:\ni.\nFirst stage\nii.\nIntermediate stage\niii.\nFinal stage\nSignificance for the user: For all staged procedures, the TMS may require the treating physician to specify\nthe stage of surgery he / she is anticipating performing at the time of booking of the package.\n2.2.9 Follow up procedures\nPackages for follow up have been included in HBP 2.0 for a few select procedures. This enables the\nhospital / caregiver to maintain a continuum of care to the patient for a period extending beyond the 15\ndays that he / she is entitled to through the original AB PM-JAY package. This would also enable the patient\nto seek follow up care for a procedure out of the center that performed the original procedure.\nFor example, a follow up procedure for ‘Stoma Management, follow up of Colostomy’ has been introduced\nin the HBP 2.0 for all patients who need such care.\nSignificance for the user: A follow up procedure may be booked by the treating hospital / caregiver with\nclear documentation supporting the need for the package. The documentation would include proof of the"}

While\nthe NHA remains cautious of the abuse prone nature of such a package, utilization of such a package\nwould be closely monitored to justify keeping it in the subsequent modifications of the HBP.\n2.2.10 Abuse Prone Packages\nWith the experience of implementing AB PM-JAY through the past year, the NHA has been able to identify\ncertain packages that are prone to abuse and require closer monitoring. Such a list of packages has been\nidentified in the TMS and a conscious attempt has been made to keep the price of abuse prone packages\nat the minimum level to minimize incentives for abuse. Booking of these packages also creates an alert at\nthe National Anti-Fraud Unit (NAFU) at the NHA and may trigger an investigation. The list of these abuse\nprone packages is held as confidential at the time of publishing of this manual.\nAnti-Fraud advisories are issued regularly providing guidance to states on measures to prevent and detect\nany malpractices in case of fraud and abuse prone packages. Fraud controls in the form of alerts, triggers\nand machine learning algorithms have been deployed which monitor the utilisation of packages and flag\nany suspect cases for medical audit and investigation. The detailed process to be followed for medical\naudit of suspect cases is available in the Field Investigation and Medical Audit Manual.\n2.2.11 Standardized nomenclature of procedures\nA conscious attempt has been made to standardize the nomenclature and definitions of packages. NHA in\ncollaboration with World Health Organization (WHO), has initiated the process of aligning HBP 2.0 with\nInternational Classification of Health Interventions (ICHI) and International Classification of Diseases (ICD)\ncoding of the WHO. When completed, India may become the first country to use ICHI in its HBP list.\nThe ICHI is being developed to provide a common tool for reporting and analyzing health interventions for\nstatistical purposes. ICHI covers interventions carried out by a broad range of providers across the full\nscope of health systems and includes interventions on diagnostic, medical, surgical, mental health, primary\ncare, allied health, functioning support, rehabilitation, traditional medicine and public health.\nRefer to (https://mitel.dimi.uniud.it/ichi/) for the search engine."}

Packages were rationalized against the following aberrations found in the original HBP\na. Package rates offered for many packages were inadequate to cover the cost of procedures\nb. Duplication of packages was observed both within a single specialty and across specialties\nc. The terminology used for the nomenclature of packages was inconsistent\nd. Few of the procedures were overlapping with the ongoing National Health Programs\ne. Some of the high-end procedures / investigations / drugs are not covered in HBP 1.0\nf. Due to the non-availability of certain treatments, a lot of procedures were being booked under\nUnspecified packages\n\n2. What is the total package count of HBP 2.0?\nA. HBP 2.0 has 874 packages split into 1592 procedures. By the new nomenclature, many packages are\na group of procedures split primarily based on surgical approach or different types of treatment\nmodalities available for a similar type of treatment. Through the first year of implementation of AB PM-\nJAY, it was felt that frequency of utilization of individual procedures is required for analysis. Hence,\nthere was a need to capture the different procedures covered under single package separately and\nthus the concept was introduced.\n\n3. How many specialties are covered in HBP 2.0?\nA. HBP 2.0 covers 23 specialties (including ‘Unspecified’). All specialties from HBP 1.0 have been\nretained except for Paediatric Cancer that has been discontinued. All procedures of paediatric cancer\nhave been split into medical / surgical oncology."}

How will these patients be treated?\nA. All the procedures of Paediatric cancer have been included under the other three specialties of\noncology viz. Surgical, Medical & Radiation Oncology. Hence Paediatric cancer specialty may not be\nvisible under specialty list, but all the paediatric cancers are adequately covered.\n5. Have prices been reduced for some procedures in HBP 2.0?\nA. Prices have been reduced for 57 procedures in HBP 2.0 as compared to HBP 1.0.\n\n6. Have prices been increased for some procedures in HBP 2.0?\nA. Prices have been increased for 270 procedures in HBP 2.0 as compared to HBP 1.0.\n\n7. What was the rationale for discontinuing packages from HBP 1.0?\nA. 554 existing packages were discontinued in HBP 2.0. Four primary principles were followed for\ndiscontinuation of packages between HBP 1.0 to HBP 2.0\na. Removal of duplicate packages\nb.

Hence, there was a need to capture the different procedures\ncovered under single package separately and thus the concept was introduced.\n\n13. Can the same package be booked under multiple specialties?\nA. There are many procedures which fall under the purview of more than one specialty. In HBP 1.0, the\npractice was to repeat the same package under every concerned specialty with individual package\ncodes and independent terminology, resulting in unnecessary repetition / duplication. Now such\nprocedures have been consolidated under a single specialty and marked as ‘Cross specialty\nprocedures’, so that they can be used by other relevant specialties as well."}

In HBP 2.0, certain procedures have been identified that involve different treatment modalities for\nsame or similar procedures e.g. type of anaesthesia, surgical approach, unilateral / bilateral, aetiology\netc. Although the difference appears minor between the multiple stratifications of a procedure, there\nis a clear financial impact of the same. Such procedures have been classified as stratified procedures\nwherein an additional layer of stratification has been added to account for additional effort / cost.\n\n15. Are implants / High end consumables included in surgical packages?\nA. Yes, the price of both these entities, wherever used, are included in the final procedure price. In many\npackages, the final total cost (including procedure and implant / consumable) is given. In other\npackages, costs of procedure and implant / consumable is given separately. In such cases, these two\ncosts are entered in the system already and reflected in the form of a final cost in the Transaction\nManagement System (TMS). Thus, it is possible that for the same package, different rates may be\nseen for certain procedures based on the type of implant / consumable selected in such cases. (Also\nrefer to answers for Q. 16 to 19)\n\n16. Can more than one implant be booked for a procedure?\nA. HBP 2.0 provisions for use of multiple implants within a procedure and independently accounts for the\nprice of each implant used. However, for most procedures, there is a cap on the maximum number of\nimplants that will be reimbursed in a procedure.\n\n17. Will the hospitals be getting reimbursed separately for the implants?\nA. No. Price of implant will be included in the price of the selected procedure. The price of the implant\nwill be added to the procedure price at the backend by the TMS and will be reflected in the final\nreimbursement. Some procedures may require details of the number / type of implant used from a\nselection dropdown to calculate the total price of implants used."}

A concept of static and dynamic pricing has been introduced in HBP 2.0 to account for variations in\nprices that are now possible in HBP 2.0 based on number / types of implants used. Procedures with\nno implants, or pre-defined included implants will follow a static price with no variations.

Is there any change in the incentives offered on the package rates under AB PM-JAY?\nA. There is no change in the NHA policy for incentives.

There is no relaxation in\nprotocols for any procedures that are booked on Day Care or Inpatient basis / in Public or Private\nHospitals / in Elective or Emergency conditions.\n\n28. Have any Fraud control measures been built into the procedures of HBP 2.0?\nA. Many Anti-Fraud measures have been built into the procedures of HBP 2.0. A few of them are as\nunder\na. Procedures within HBP 2.0 have been identified to be fraud prone and would be under scrutiny by\nthe National Anti-Fraud unit (NAFU) at the NHA. Utilization of these packages may trigger show-\ncause response from the NHA.\nb. Prices of some procedures have been consciously kept at a bare minimum to avoid temptation of\nhospitals to abuse the same.\nc. In cases where the patient undergoes multiple rounds of treatment, the minimum interval between\ntwo consecutive treatment interventions has been configured in the IT system, wherever applicable\ne.g. Appendicectomy, Hysterectomy, Cataract etc.\nd. The maximum number of times a procedure can be booked for an individual patient has been\nintegrated in the IT system, wherever applicable\ne. Implants / High End Consumables usage has been defined at the procedure level where both the\ntype of Implants / High End Consumables and their maximum permissible limit of usage has been\ndetailed out"}

Is there any relationship between the packages of HBP 1.0 & the procedures of HBP 2.0?\nA. The procedures of HBP 2.0 have been mapped back with the packages of HBP 1.0. The list of mapped\npackages and procedures is available on the website of AB PM-JAY.\n\n30. How are the new package codes different from HBP 1.0?\nA. A unique alpha - numeric code comprising of five characters is assigned to each package. The first\ntwo alphabets of the package code denote the primary specialty and the three numbers denote the\nserial number of packages under the primary specialty. The sequence of packages is aligned\naccording to their organ systems or the type of treatment modality involved.\n\n31. Is there a standardized nomenclature of procedures in HBP 2.0?\nA. In collaboration with World Health Organization (WHO), the NHA has initiated the process of aligning\nHBP 2.0 with International Classification of Health Interventions (ICHI) and International Classification\nof Diseases (ICD) coding of the WHO.\n\n32. Are there any guidelines with respect to reservation of packages for Public Hospitals?\nA. It is the discretion of the States to reserve packages for public hospitals based on their local conditions\nand infrastructure availability. However, as with HBP 1.0, certain procedures such as Hysterectomy,\nHigh Risk Delivery and Mental health packages have been recommended by the National Health\nAuthority to be reserved for Public Hospitals. The same will continue to be reserved for Public Hospitals\nfor HBP 2.0\n\n33. Can states still add state specific packages to supplement HBP 2.0?\nA. Yes. States are still at liberty to add state specific packages. However, prior approval from the NHA is\nmandatory that would ensure that the requested packages do not fall in the exclusion criteria of the\nscheme, or that the packages do not prior exist in the national master."}

What is the process for States to add their own state specific packages to supplement HBP\n2.0?\nA. In collaboration with World Health Organization (WHO), the NHA has initiated the process of aligning\nHBP 2.0 with International Classification of Health Interventions (ICHI) and International Classification\nof Diseases (ICD) coding of the WHO. The same mapping will need to be adopted by the states before\nsubmitting their proposed list to the NHA for approval. The NHA would scan the list to cull out any\nduplicate procedures with the National list, as well as procedures that fall within the exception criteria\nof the scheme. States will also be required to send in their proposal with a reasonable justification for\ninclusion of their packages to the satisfaction of the NHA medical panel.\n\n35. Do States have the flexibility to alter package rates?\nA. Package / Procedure rates recommended by the NHA in HBP 2.0 have been arrived to through a\nscientific and rigorous process of costing exercises and committee recommendations. However, it is\nalso accepted that costs and prices of services may vary between states. To account for the same,\nthe states have the flexibility of increase the recommended rates anywhere within 10% for their specific\nstate / UT. However, the states have the liberty to reduce the rates to any limits owing to conditions\nspecific to their state.\n\n36. What is the Minimum Document Protocol for HBP 2.0?\nA. A set of mandatory documents have been defined for each package / procedure within the HBP 2.0.\nThese documents would need to be mandatorily uploaded at the time of raising a pre-auth, or for\nraising a claim. These documents comprise the MDP / ‘Minimum document Protocol’ for HBP 2.0.\nThese are available in the Transaction management System\n\n37. Is there a defined Average Length of Stay (ALOS) for procedures booked under HBP 2.0?\nA. No. There is no minimum / maximum length of stay defined for any procedure under HBP 2.0. Any\ndefined ALOS published for patient care under HBP 2.0 is purely indicative and is not expected to be\nrestrictive to patient care in any way."}

The effective date of implementation, of HBP 2.0 will be state specific i.e. each state is expected to\nadopt the same as soon as possible subject to administrative feasibility.\n\n39. How do States prepare for HBP 2.0? Are there any IT related expectations?\nA. For all states using the NHA TMS, the transition to HBP 2.0 would be automated from the backend\nand would require no preparations at the State level. For states using their own Transaction\nManagement Systems, there would be preparations required that would be facilitated by the IT teams\nat NHA. Beyond IT, the States would be expected to facilitate and ensure trainings of all stakeholders\ninvolved as the system transitions to the newer version."}

Standard treatment guidelines (STGs) for\nEfficient Health Care\nA minimum standard of care is needed by every\nindividual seeking medical treatment in a healthcare\nfacility or by a healthcare professional. For any clinical\nconditions, it is imperative for health caregivers to be\nguided\nby\nstandard\ncare\nguidelines/pathways\nto\ncomplement them to provide an acceptable level of\nquality care to the patients. Hence formulating STGs\ncould be a beacon for health care.\nGiven the emphasis that is being placed on health under\nthe various ministries of the Government of India,\nmethodical planning like STG could provide an umbrella\nfor medical professionals and for patients too. This is not\njust an ambitious step but an essential one that could\nrevolutionize health care not only in India but probably in\nmost developing countries. It would entail keeping the\nfinger on the pulse to include newer developments in the\nfields covering a plethora of diseases. The following\ndocument covers the advantage of STGs, its methodology\nin the application, and how it could prevent fraud\ntreatments in high-risk areas.\nAs has been detailed later in the document, many STGs/\nclinical\nguidelines/\nclinical\npathways\nhave\nbeen\nformulated\nfor\nyears\nby\nvarious\nclinical\nbodies/\nfederations/ organizations. However, this is the first\nattempt\nmade,\nespecially\nthrough\nthe\nlargest\nGovernment-funded public health insurance/assurance\nscheme, to not just have package specific guidance\ndocuments but also have them integrated into the IT\nsystem to enable uptake and adherence to the\nguidelines. Further, a dashboard specific to these STGs\nhas also been developed for monitoring and analysis\npurposes.\n3.\nINTRODUCTION\n3.1.\nAyushman\nBharat\nPradhan\nMantri\nJan\nAarogya Yojana (AB PM-JAY)\nAyushman Bharat, a flagship scheme of Government of\nIndia, was launched as recommended by the National\nHealth Policy 2017, to achieve the vision of Universal\nHealth Coverage (UHC). This initiative has been designed\nto meet Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and its\nunderlining commitment, which is to \"leave no one\nbehind\".\nAyushman Bharat is an attempt to move from sectoral\nand segmented approach of health service delivery to a\ncomprehensive need-based health care service. This\nscheme aims to undertake path breaking interventions to\nholistically address the healthcare system (covering\nprevention, promotion and ambulatory care) at the\nprimary, secondary and tertiary level.\nAyushman Bharat adopts a continuum of care approach,\ncomprising of two inter-related components, which are -\n• Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs)\n• Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY)\nHealth and Wellness Centres (HWCs): These centers seek\nto promote individuals and communities to adopt healthy\nlifestyles and take control of their health by bringing\nservices closer to the community. They are therefore free\nto users and provide a wide variety of services including\nmaternal\nand\nchild\nhealth\nservices,\ncare\nfor\nnon-communicable diseases, palliative and rehabilitative\ncare, oral, eye and ENT care, mental health etc. To\nensure continuum of care, 1,50,000 health and wellness\ncenters will be set up with improved infrastructure,\nassured availability of drugs and diagnostic services\nalong with strengthening of referral mechanisms and\ncommunity linkages."}

RATIONALE FOR STANDARD TREATMENT\nGUIDELINES\n“Standard Treatment Guideline (STG) is a systematically\ndeveloped statement designed to assist practitioners and\npatients in making decisions about appropriate health\ncare for specific clinical circumstances” – World Health\nOrganization (WHO) (1)\n4.1. Purpose and Content\nAn\neffectively\nimplemented\nguidelines\n(STGs)\nis\nadvantageous for beneficiaries, healthcare providers,\nsupply managers, and health policy makers.\nGlobal Scenario\nBack in 1999, when clinical guideline development was\nsoaring in Europe, North America, Australia, New\nZealand, and Africa, a published article (2) mentioned\nthe potential benefits and limitations of developing\nclinical guidelines across health care professionals,\npatients, and health systems. The focus was clinical\nguidelines being the only way to improve quality of care,\nand limitations were on the quality in the development of\nthe guidelines, including the group members, influence\nof opinions and clinical experience, and optimization of\npatient`s perspective. The article emphasized on rigorous\ndevelopment of evidence-based guidelines minimizing\nthe potential risks, or it could lead to suboptimal,\nineffective, or harmful practices.\nSTGs are currently in use in parts of the United States,\nEurope, Latin America, Asia, Africa, and the Western\nPacific. As has been seen that improper use or misuse of\nmedicines in the treatment of any medical condition is\nrampant, which can be detrimental to people. The idea\nbehind having STG is to have standardisation in terms of\ntreatment and promote effective and efficient treatment\noptions.\nSuch guidelines may be used at different stages of the\ntherapeutic process. It could include medical supplies as\nalso following prescribed treatments. It could assist in\nbetter diagnosis and look at preventive services. As STGs\nare disease-specific, a publication of relevant documents\nand\ntheir\nproper\nupdation\nwould\nhelp\nmedical\npractitioners. If implemented properly, STGs can be\ninclusive in their application (1).\nThe HWCs herald a whole new scene in increasing\nresponsiveness of health care services and in reaching\nthe needs of marginalized sections of society with primary\nhealth care teams. Several Sub health Centers (SHCs),\nPrimary Health Centers (PHCs) and Urban Health Centers\n(UHCs) are going to be made into Health Wellness\nCenters by 2022.\nThe second component under Ayushman Bharat is the\nPradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana or AB PM-JAY as\nit is popularly known. This scheme was launched on 23rd\nSeptember 2018 in Ranchi, Jharkhand by the Hon’ble\nPrime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi. National\nHealth Authority (NHA) is the Nodal Agency set up for\nscheme implementation and oversight.\nAB PM-JAY is the largest health assurance scheme in the\nworld which aims at providing a health cover of Rs. 5\nlakhs per family per year for secondary and tertiary care\nhospitalization to over 10.74 crores poor and vulnerable\nfamilies (approximately 50 crore beneficiaries) that form\nthe bottom 40% of the Indian population.\nThe primary objectives for launching AB PM-JAY were to\nensure\ncomprehensive\ncoverage\nfor\ncatastrophic\nillnesses, reduce catastrophic out-of-pocket expenditure,\nimprove access to hospitalisation care, reduce unmet\nneeds, and to converge various health insurance schemes\nacross the States.\nThe benefit cover under the scheme includes INR\n5,00,000 on a family floater basis which can be used by\none or all members of the family. AB PM-JAY has been\ndesigned in such a way that there is no cap on family size\nor age of members. In addition, pre-existing diseases are\ncovered from the very first day. This means that any\neligible person suffering from any medical condition\nbefore being covered by AB PM-JAY will now be able to\nget treatment for all those medical conditions as well\nunder this scheme right away without any waiting period."}

Guidelines are developed by the expert panel\nand\nare\ngraded\ndifferently\nfrom\nevidence-based\npractices, which increases the individual variability\namong care providers and might have a difference of\nopinion. Developing homogenous clinical care can also\nbe considered difficult to implement as patients, and\nclinical circumstances are heterogeneous. Hence, some\nvariability and flexibility in the practices were productive.\nThe study focused on the importance of the following\nparameters, clearly defined scope of the guideline,\ngrading system of evidence-based practices, external\npeer review, and regular updating (3).\nThe Agency for Healthcare research and quality\naddressed\nthe\nchallenges\nin\nmeasuring\ncare\nco-ordination using electronic data. These included (4):\n1. Underutilization of health IT system capabilities and\nclinical workflow barriers.\n2. Lack of data standardization and limited health IT\nsystem interoperability.\n3. Unknown clinical data quality in electronic data\nsources.\n4. Limitations in linking data.\n5. Technical hurdles to accessing data.\n6. Business models that facilitate competition rather than\ncooperation.\nPotential solutions addressed to the above-mentioned\nchallenges included structured data fields into the IT\nsystems instead of text free writing and utilizing support\nstaff\nto\nenter\nsome\ninformation\nhelps\nin\ncare\nco-ordination; mapping consistencies in the coding\nsystem at the granular level example like medication\nunits, laboratory results, diagnosis, etc. It also covered\ndeveloping indicators for the evaluation of reliability and\naccuracy of IT data; linking data to policymakers and\npublic overcomes privacy barriers; designing the IT\nsystem for easy accessibility of data to end-users, and\nfinancial support to help overcome business model\nbarriers that have hindered information sharing and care\nco-ordination.\nIndian perspective\nStudies from India explicated developing guidelines from\nmany States and authorities, but major limitations as\nstated in KOLI et al. (5) in implementation included\n“multiplicity, paucity of Indian literature, failure to\nperiodically revise guidelines, failure to tailor them\naccording to the level of healthcare and a lack of\navailability and accessibility” making India dependent on\nthe quality of evidence from developed countries. It was\nalso noticed that in the UK, one statutory body (NICE)\ndeveloped, promoted, and disseminated the guidelines\nnationally, whereas the USA, on the other hand, had\nmultiple\nagencies\nframing\nthe\nSTGs\nbased\non\nhigh-quality evidence. USA STGs and NICE guidelines did\nnot reveal the cost of treatment and nor strategized on\nlevels of healthcare.\nOther studies (6,7) explained the main challenges for\ninitiating the STG development process itself, including a\nvague understanding of the mechanism, onboarding\nexpertise panel, challenges to streamline specialists and\ngeneralists,\ninternational\nadaptation\nof\npragmatic\napproach, time constraint, lengthy process, and financial\nsupport\nto\nsustain\nthe\ntask\nforce.\nHowever,\nadapting/adopting evidence-based guidelines should be\nallaying to the local context tailored to diverse clinical\npractice, varied resource settings, and acceptance by the\nprescribers. Though there are many standardized\nadaptation frameworks available, a uniform global\napproach, especially for developing countries, can ease\nthe process to suit the local context. Investments in a\nNational nodal agency to either adopt, adapt or develop\nSTGs along with dissemination, impact evaluation, and\ntimely revision were considered crucial.\nAll in all, there is a substantial evidence on the benefits of\nSTGs focusing on rationalizing health care services,\nthereby improving the quality of care.

Aim and Objectives\nThe aim of having STGs was to develop guidelines for AB\nPM-JAY Health Benefit Packages by adoption and\ncustomization of available Standard Treatment Workflows\ndeveloped by DHR/ICMR, National Cancer Grid (NCG),\nState Guidelines, Ministry guidelines, and other globally\naccepted standard treatment protocols as per the\nscheme’s requirement.\nThe objectives of STGs are to aid the Pre-authorization\nProcessing Doctor (PPD) and Claims Processing Doctor\n(CPD) at the time of pre-authorization and claims\nprocessing by specifying the mandatory documentation\nrequired and specific things to look for in these\ndocuments for the prescribed procedure; to help prevent\nand control fraud and abuse; to provide quality care to\nthe beneficiaries by bringing uniformity in documentation\nacross empanelled healthcare providers; and to serve as\na Guidance Tool for treating doctors, Empanelled Health\nCare Providers (EHCPs), Third-party Administrators\n(TPAs), Implementing Support Agency (ISAs), State Health\nAgencies (SHAs) and medical auditors.\n4.5.\nProcess\ncarried\nout\nat\nDHR/ICMR\nfor\ndeveloping STWs\nIt was felt that various prevailing treatment guidelines\nwere not easy to follow and hence were not properly\nutilized by the busy clinicians in India as the workload is\nmuch higher than other smaller countries. This led to the\nformulation of Standard Treatment Workflows (STWs) that\nwere designed in such a manner that they were\nuser-friendly at the same time keeping in mind the\nfeasibility of the country’s health system in the\nbackground. Department of Health Research-Indian\nCouncil of Medical Research (DHR-ICMR) created a\nthree-peer review mechanism to give a concrete shape to\nthe workflows. Subject expert group committees were\nformed by inviting clinical experts from Premier Medical\nInstitutes, Medical Colleges and private sector. A\nSecretariat was created staffed by clinical scientists and\nlead by a Public Health Expert with sound clinical\nbackground to navigate the discussions in a format that\nwas resource stratified. An Editorial Board was created to\nstreamline the care pathways. The Advisory Committee\ngave supportive supervision to the whole exercise.\nICMR STWs were developed to formulate treatment\nalgorithms for common and serious medical and surgical\nconditions for both Out-patient Department (OPD) and\nIn-patient department (IPD) management at primary,\nsecondary and tertiary levels of India’s healthcare system\nthat are scientific, robust, and locally contextual (8). The\nobjective of these STWs was to ensure appropriate\ndisease management and quality services through\njudicious use of hospital-based interventions and the\ncreation of stronger referral linkages with other levels\nof care.\nFigure 1: The process flow adapted by NHA from conceptualization to rolling out the STGs\n5.

Many a times, for developing one STG,\nmultiple procedures and multiple disease-based\nguidelines had to be mapped.\n3.\nNon availability of many experts for timely feedback\nespecially during pandemic\n\nMost of the experts are nationally / internationally\nacclaimed clinicians from some of the most reputed\nmedical hospitals and colleges in the country.\n\nEspecially during the current pandemic and due\nto\ntheir\nengagement\nin\nadditional\ntasks\n/responsibilities, the feedback from experts took a lot\nof time for review and finalization of the documents.\nSpecialty prioritization had to be done based on\navailability of experts. Online discussions and\npersonal follow-up were also done to ensure speedy\nreview by experts.\n4.\nState wise auto-approved and government reserved\npackages\n\nMany\nStates\nhave\ndifferent\npackages\nas\nauto-approved and government reserved in contrast\nto the national master. The STGs for these States had\nto be integrated in IT system accordingly.\n5.\nPilots couldn’t be completed due to limitation on\ntravel due to pandemic\n\nPilots & orientation were conducted in 6 States/UTs\nonly-Assam, Manipur, Kerala, Haryana, Andhra\nPradesh and Chandigarh. Rest of the planned pilots\nhad to be aborted due to the pandemic.\n6.\nLimited implementation in States using their own IT\nsystem\n\nSome States are still using their State specific IT\nplatform which limits the utilization of integrated\nSTGs in these States except for portability cases. A\nseparate orientation was held, and the IT documents\nrequired for customization were shared and followed\nup by sending communications to these States to\nintegrate at the earliest."}

However, this was later extended to all\npackages under HBP2.0 and corresponding HBP1.0\npackages. The sudden increase in the requirement\nof STGs for all procedures was coupled with limited\ndedicated human resource for undertaking this task\nfor development, review and integration in IT for\nwhich the team was later expanded.\n8.\nPackages\nfor\nmost\nof\nthe\nspecialties\nwere\nnon-rationalized\n\nMany of the specialties where the packages were\nnot rationalized in HBP2.0 and were adopted as it is\nat HBP1.0 rates including duplicacy in some\npackages across specialties. As a result of this some\nof the specialized mandatory investigations required\ncould not be justified in the existing packages rates.\nWhile making STGs it was observed that, the\nnon-rationalized packages of HBP 1.0 duplicating\nespecially across specialties also had different rates.\nThis also led to issues in mapping procedures as\nwell. These will be addressed in the next revision of\nhealth benefit packages 3 (HBP3.0). Many States are\nstill transitioning to HBP2.0 and STGs had to be\nmapped with non-rationalized packages of HBP1.0.\n17.2. Lessons learnt\n1.\nCustomisation of the available guidelines to match\nthe available on-ground resources\n\nMany guidelines referred for developing STGs had\nlimited information pertaining to aspects like\nminimum infrastructure and qualifications of the\ntreating doctors. Also, at times these were too ideal,\nwhich had to be matched with the on-field\navailability of the resources while striking a\nbalancing between essential and ideal.\n2.\nOnly most essential mandatory documents to be\nincluded for public hospitals\n\nSome relaxation has been given to public hospitals\nfor mandatory documents for each procedure\nconsidering the limited resources available and\npatient load in these hospitals at the time of\npre-authorization. For private hospitals, mandatory\ndocuments have been kept stringent to prevent fraud\nand ensure quality care is given to the beneficiaries.\n3.\nInterlinkages of different IT modules (TMS with HEM)\n\nInterlinkages within the AB PM-JAY IT modules- TMS\nand HEM are being worked out to ensure that the\npackages are booked and carried out in the hospitals\nhaving minimum required infrastructure and by\ndoctors having minimum required qualifications.\n4.\nDeveloping FAQs, online training sessions and\nmodules for States\n\nDue to the requirements of continuous capacity\nbuilding of hospitals/processing teams due to turn\nover of staff in each State/ district, online training\nvideos and modules have been developed for\nTraining of Trainers (ToTs) for States and hospitals. All\nqueries received during online orientation have been\ntranslated to Frequently asked questions (FAQs)\nwhich are readily available on the AB PM-JAY\nwebsite. With a view to ensure quality care for\nCOVID-19\ntesting\n&\ntreatment,\nimmediate\ndevelopment of Standard Treatment Guidelines for\nthese packages has also been done.\n5.\nComprehensive rationalisation of all health benefit\npackages\n\nGiven the feedback from experts and other\nstakeholders while developing the STGs, a process to\nrationalize the health benefit packages has been\ninitiated."}

FUTURE VISION AND ROADMAP\nThe teams involved in formulating comprehensive STGs\nunderstand the necessity of the programme not as a\none-time effort but a continuous process. With this\nobjective,\nempanelment\nof\nhospitals\n(Hospital\nempanelment module (HEM 2.0)) which would be\nempowered to synchronise with the STGs has already\nbegun. The empanelment criteria have been drawn from\nthe guidance documents and the minimum requirements\nfor hospitals to get into this criterion is formulated.\nBased on the inputs received from Experts and States\n(SHAs) an interim revision has been done in HBP 2.0 with\nthe addition of a few more packages (now termed as HBP\n2.1) which is in the process of being integrated so as to\ninclude new packages and procedures for common\ndiseases.\nAfter\nconsulting\nspeciality\nexperts,\nthe\npackages would be finalized and drafted accordingly\nand STGs for the same would be developed.\nThis is indeed an ambitious venture under AB PM-JAY and\nconcerted efforts can make it successful for better\nhealthcare delivery and attain global standardisation.\n18.1.\nWay Forward\nThe trajectory ahead lies to complete integration and\nrelease of remaining STGs. It will be imperative to have\nperiodic orientation and training in States/UTs/EHCPs.\nSystematic review of feedback from States/ hospitals/\nTPAs & ISA (through States) will go a long way for\nstrengthening of STG implementation. There is also a\nnecessity of monitoring adherence and conducting\nimpact evaluation to these guidelines through data\nanalytics entailing IT platforms on certain specific pack-\nages in selected states. This will help modifications and\nupdating of the STG development process in the\ndue course.\n19. REFERENCES\n1.\nManagement Sciences for Health and World Health\nOrganization. 2007.

The\nhospitals can also refer to this document so that they\nmay have the insight on how the pre-auth and\nclaims will be processed. However, this document\ndoesn’t provide any guidance on clinical and\ntherapeutic management of patient. In that respect\nthe hospitals and physicians may refer to other\nrelevant material as per the extant professional\nnorms. The decision for admission, discharge,\napproving/ disapproving the case will depend on\nthe decision of the treating doctor, the hospital and\nthe processing team. Ultimately the professional\njudgment of the healthcare professionals should be\nused. Deviations from the guidelines may be\nmonitored and enquired into by experts to check if\nthese were justified or not.\n10. Are there any training documents/ manual\navailable on use of STGs?\n\nYes, the STG presentation and STG IT training\nmanual is available on AB PM-JAY website link:\nhttps://pmjay.gov.in/standard_treatment_guidelines.\nTraining videos and online training module have\nalso been developed and are available at the AB\nPM- JAY website on the above link.\n11. What will be the use/ benefits of these STGs?\n\na. It will help standardize the documents being\nsubmitted by the hospitals\n\nb. Lead to reduction in number of queries and\nrepeat transactions\n\nc. Decrease unnecessary delay in processing of\npre-auth and claims and aid timely payment to\nhospitals\n\nd. Bring\nin\nmore\naccountability\nat\nall\nlevels- MEDCO, PPD, CPD\n\ne. Improve quality of care by avoiding unnecessary\ntreatment with focus on appropriateness of care\n\nf. Promote choosing the relevant package as per\nthe patient requirement\n\ng. Prevent fraud and abuse\n12. Will the deployment of STGs have an impact on\na States policy with the insurance company?\n\nSTGs should not have any impact on the policy with\nthe insurance company, since the package rates are\nnot impacted. In fact, it intends to help prevent fraud\nand abuse, improve quality of care of the patients\nand reduce the number of queries raised to the\nhospitals.\n13. Some\nState\nsponsored\nschemes\nare\nimplementing Standard treatment protocols?\nThen what is new in AB PM-JAY STGs?\n\nYes,\nsome\nState\nsponsored\nschemes\nare\nimplementing\nStandard\nTreatment\nprotocols.\nHowever, all those are manually being referred so\nfar. Under AB PM-JAY, STGs have been integrated in\nthe IT system in the form of mandatory documents,\nquestionnaire.\nMinimum\nqualifications\nof\nthe\ntreating\ndoctor\nand\nminimum\ninfrastructure\nrequirement have also been clarified which will be\nlinked to the empanelment module soon. Our\nguidelines also have drawn upon the existing state\nguidelines wherever available.\n14. Are these STGs also applicable to State schemes\nalso?\n\nStates can consider adopting it for their other state\nschemes as well.\n15. Will the STGs be applicable to government\nreserved packages also?\n\nYes. STGs will be applicable to all government\nreserved packages also."}

Process specific FAQs\n1.\nWhat are the key changes in TMS workflow\nwith the introduction of STGs?\n\na. The guidelines are available for download\n\nb. The\nmandatory\ndocuments\nhave\nbeen\nrationalized\n\nc. A mandatory checklist (in the form of a\nquestionnaire) has been included\n2.\nIs it mandatory to fill the questionnaire or Can\nMEDCO/ PPD/ CPD proceed the case in TMS\nwithout filling the questionnaire?\n\nFilling the questionnaire in the TMS is a mandatory\nstep for raising a pre-auth, initiating claim and\nprocessing a pre-auth and claim for both public and\nprivate hospitals.\n3.\nWhat happens if the answer filled is opposite\nto the expected answer? Will it lead to rejection\nof the case?\n\nIf the answer filled is opposite to the expected\nanswer it will not lead to rejection but the PPD/ CPD\nshould raise a query to the MEDCO in case of any\nconcerns and seek clarification.\n4.\nAre the mandatory documents same for public\nand private hospitals?\n\nYes. For public hospitals, for certain packages,\nrequirement of mandatory documents has been\nreduced. In case SHA decides to make any\ndocument non-mandatory it must intimate, giving\njustification and take concurrence of NHA.\n5.\nWill\nthe\nquestionnaire\ndiffer\nwith\neach\nprocedure?\n\nYes, the questionnaire is different for each\nprocedure. Few questions may be common to all,\nbut most are customized as per the requirement of\nthe procedure.\n\nFor e.g. Barcode for implant is asked only in those\ncases where implant has been used. Similarly,\nspecific investigations are asked for each procedure.\n6.\nAlready some questions are asked at PPD/ CPD\nlevel? How is STG questionnaire different from\nthose existing?\n\nThe questions that were asked so far at the PPD/\nCPD level were medical audit questions by the\nauditors. The STG questionnaires are for MEDCO,\nPPD and CPD and are integrated in the IT system.\nThe response to these questions may be monitored\nby the auditors.\n7.\nWill the STGs enable introduction of auto query\nfeature for PPD/ CPD?\n\nNo. Currently the auto query feature is not enabled\nfor PPD/ CPD with the introduction of STG.\n8.\nHow does one confirm that they have opened/\nreferred/ read the STG?\n\nCurrently this feature is not enabled. We hope that\nthe pop up will remind the concerned to open and\nrefer the STGs as this will come for each case of the\nspecific package whenever it is booked/processed.\n9.\nCan the SHA decide to make certain mandatory\ndocuments non-mandatory?\n\nIn case SHA decides to make any document\nnon-mandatory it must intimate, giving justification\nand\ntake\nconcurrence\nof\nNHA.\n(email:\nstg.hnqa@nha.gov.in)\n10. Can a State/ UT opt for using STGs for a few\npackages only as per the requirement of the\nState/ UT?\n\nNo. The STGs for all packages will be integrated in\nthe IT system in a phased manner. States cannot pick\nand choose only for specific packages.\n11. Can a State/ UT do away with STGs for\ngovernment reserved packages?\n\nNo. We are moving towards quality of care across\nboth public and private hospitals and would be\nworking towards standardized approaches. The\npublic hospitals are also paid at par in most states so\naccountability to public funds is uniform across type\nof hospitals to ensure quality of care to beneficiaries."}

Can the State/ UT start to implement STGs with\nonly private hospitals?\n\nYes if absolutely needed for a short time-frame but\neventually it has to be extended to all hospitals, but\nthe same has to be officially conveyed to NHA with\njustification-\ne-mail:\nstg.hnqa@nha.gov.in\nand\nobtain concurrence.\n13. Some States have changed the mandatory\ndocument requirement for certain packages.\nWhat about uploading mandatory documents\nfor such packages in these States?\n\nThe SHA may share details of such packages\nthrough e-mail: stg.hnqa@nha.gov.in and the\nreason for their decision to NHA for concurrence.\nHowever, the change will only be made at the State\nlevel if NHA approves and not at the national level.\nFor portability cases the national mandatory\ndocuments will still continue to be applicable.\n\n14. Are these STGs also applicable to those States\nwho are using their own IT software (other than\nNTMS)?\n\nThe adoption of STGs by all States/UTs is\nmandatory. NHA recommends that all SHAs migrate\nto IT system developed and maintained by the NHA.\nTill this is done, the States which are using their own\nIT software are encouraged to adopt these in their\nsystem as well, at the earliest. NHA has initiated\ntime-bound facilitation of this process. However, for\nportability cases for specific packages it will be\napplicable as and when they are integrated\nin NTMS.\n15. What are the implications for non-compliance?\n\nIt is mandatory to upload the mandatory documents\nand fill the questionnaire. The steps have to be\nfollowed to initiate the pre-auth, discharge or\nprocess the case. It will lead to accountability on the\nperson filling the questionnaire. If the answer filled\nin is opposite of the expected answer without due\njustification may lead to raising a query by the PPD/\nCPD. The monitoring of adherence to STGs\n\nwill also be done at the national level by NHA and\nnecessary directions to concerned states/hospitals\nwill also be issued as and when any major deviations\nare noticed.\n16. Mandatory documents were required earlier\nalso. Then what is the change after the\nintroduction of STGs?\n\nMandatory documents have been rationalized with\nthe introduction of STGs.\n17. Can the PPD/ CPD reject a case if the mandatory\ndocument hasn’t been uploaded/ a wrong\ndocument has been uploaded?\n\nPPD/ CPD must raise a query in such a case and\nclarify from the hospital and then follow the rejection\nprocess as established by the States/ National Health\nauthority under Claims Adjudication. The claims\nadjudication\nmanual\nis\navailable\nat\nhttps://pmjay.gov.in/resources/documents\n(under\nClaim Adjudication)\n18. Will there be an autogenerated standard\nremark of the case being rejected if the\nrelevant mandatory document is not uploaded?\n\nNo such remark will be generated. The PPD/ CPD\nmust raise a query in such a case and clarify from the\nhospital. If even after such query, the document is\nnot submitted in 7 days, the claim may be rejected."}

Will there be a warning sign/ pop-up alert for\nMEDCO at the time of blocking any package if\nthere is any mismatch between the package\nbooked and age/ gender of the patient?\n\nThis feature is currently available for gender in TMS\nfor MEDCO as well as PPD & CPD. Further, certain\nquestions for some packages have also been\nincluded in specific STGs to verify this mismatch.\n21. Will the STGs and its questionnaire be\napplicable for Bulk approval at SHA level as\nwell?\n\nThis is not applicable currently for bulk approval by\nSHA. The SHA may use the STGs for further\nguidance in individual cases.\n22. Are STGs available for surgical complications also?\n\nSTGs will be made available only for those surgical\ncomplication package that are available in HBP2.0\nand corresponding HBP1.0 packages. For e.g.\n‘Excessive bleeding requiring re-exploration’, etc.\n23. How will the PPD questions appear in auto\napproved cases?\n\nFor auto approved cases, the PPD questions will\nappear in CPD questionnaire.\n24.

Introduction\n1.1.The Government of India launched the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Manti Jan Arogya Yojana\n(PM-JAY) in September 2018. The core aim of this scheme is to reduce the financial burden on\nthe poorest and most vulnerable population and ensure their access to quality health services,\nto accelerate India’s progress towards the achievement of Universal Health Coverage (UHC).\nPM-JAY covers the bottom 40 percent of the Indian population or about 10.74 crore households.\nThe inclusion of households is based on the deprivation and occupational criteria of the Socio-\nEconomic Caste Census 2011 (SECC 2011) for rural and urban areas. PM-JAY covers secondary\nand tertiary care costs of up to Rs. 5,00,000 annually for each entitled family, provided through\na network of public and empaneled private hospitals.\n1.2.The service provider network under PM-JAY includes government healthcare facilities having 5\nor more beds capable of providing inpatient services and large numbers of empaneled private\nhospitals across states where PM-JAY is implemented. This deemed empanelment of public\nproviders under the PM-JAY provides them with an unprecedented opportunity to mobilise and\nindependently manage revenues earned through claims for treatment provided to PM-JAY\nbeneficiaries. Private hospitals empaneled under PM-JAY are expected to benefit from\neconomies of scale for PM-JAY beneficiaries and assured timely payment within the stipulated\ntimeline through a web-based system.\n\n2. Purpose and Scope\n2.1. These guidelines aim to provide a framework to the State Health Agencies (SHA) under which\nthe empanelment of healthcare service providers may be undertaken. It establishes the\nprocesses that may be undertaken by the SHA to empanel a health care service provider and to\nundertake any disciplinary proceedings/ de- empanelment of health care service providers\nwherever needed. The states have the flexibility to adapt these guidelines based on local\ncontextual variations and state laws, as applicable."}

Empanelment of Healthcare Providers- Approach & Criteria\n3.1.Approach for Empanelment\n3.1.1. All States/Union Territories can empanel healthcare providers only in their own State/UT.\n3.1.2. To improve access and increase utilization of services, if SHA determines the need to\nempanel healthcare service providers outside one’s own state, SHA can approach NHA with\nthe specific request with rationale for the same. NHA will review the request with the\nhospital state1, and after ascertaining need may request the hospital state to empanel the\nhospital. If the hospital state is a non-PM-JAY implementing state, NHA shall prefer to direct\nempanel the healthcare provider or may designate specific SHAs for empanelment of health\ncare service providers accordingly.\n3.1.3. Any public healthcare facility with the capacity to provide services covered under PM-JAY\ncan be empaneled. If the facility is below CHC level, it must raise pre-authorizations within 6\nmonths of empanelment otherwise they will be moved to invalid public hospital bucket in\nconsultation with respective SHAs. After being moved to invalid public hospital bucket, the\nfacility can again be moved to approved for empanelment bucket on discretion of SHA.\n3.1.4. SHA must ensure empanelment of all public facilities (along with any in-patient or day care\nservices outsourced by the public healthcare facility) providing inpatient services or those\ncovering daycare packages covered under AB PM-JAY.\n\n1 State where the hospital is situated."}

All healthcare service providers empaneled under the scheme including the public hospitals\nwhich are deemed empaneled must mandatorily adhere to the registration process on the\nweb portal.\n3.1.7. Private hospitals are encouraged to provide ROHINI ID provided by Insurance Information\nBureau (IIB) and public hospitals are encouraged to have National Identification Number\n(NIN) provided by MoHFW.\n3.1.8. Healthcare service providers are encouraged to attain quality milestones by attaining PM-\nJAY Certification i.e., Bronze, Silver and Gold. These quality certifications would also provide\nincentive in terms of higher price for health benefit packages to the healthcare service\nproviders under the scheme.\n3.1.9. For the healthcare service providers which were empanelled based on Quality\nCertification/accreditation, health care service providers will undergo a renewal process,\nonce every 3 years or till the expiry of validity of PM-JAY Bronze/NABH certification\nwhichever is earlier; to determine compliance to minimum standards.\n3.1.10. National Health Authority may revise the empanelment criteria from time to time during the\nscheme if required.

The cost of the AM in that facility should be borne by the Private EHCP. \n  \n4. Placement of Ayushman Mitra \nAMs will be placed at every public EHCP. The exact numbers of AMs to be placed shall be dependent on the \naverage case-load per day. A suggestive placement of AM based on cases registered per day is given below.  \n(i) 0-10 Cases – 1 AM \n(ii) 10-20 Cases – 2 AMs \n(iii) 20-30 Cases – 3 AMs \n(iv) 30-40 Cases – 4 AMs \n \n"}

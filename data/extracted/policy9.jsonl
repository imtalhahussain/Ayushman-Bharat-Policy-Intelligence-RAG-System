{"page": 6, "text": " \n  \nPage 6 of 62 \n1. Introduction \n1.1.The Government of India launched the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Manti Jan Arogya Yojana \n(PM-JAY) in September 2018. The core aim of this scheme is to reduce the financial burden on \nthe poorest and most vulnerable population and ensure their access to quality health services, \nto accelerate India’s progress towards the achievement of Universal Health Coverage (UHC). \nPM-JAY covers the bottom 40 percent of the Indian population or about 10.74 crore households. \nThe inclusion of households is based on the deprivation and occupational criteria of the Socio-\nEconomic Caste Census 2011 (SECC 2011) for rural and urban areas. PM-JAY covers secondary \nand tertiary care costs of up to Rs. 5,00,000 annually for each entitled family, provided through \na network of public and empaneled private hospitals. \n1.2.The service provider network under PM-JAY includes government healthcare facilities having 5 \nor more beds capable of providing inpatient services and large numbers of empaneled private \nhospitals across states where PM-JAY is implemented. This deemed empanelment of public \nproviders under the PM-JAY provides them with an unprecedented opportunity to mobilise and \nindependently manage revenues earned through claims for treatment provided to PM-JAY \nbeneficiaries. Private hospitals empaneled under PM-JAY are expected to benefit from \neconomies of scale for PM-JAY beneficiaries and assured timely payment within the stipulated \ntimeline through a web-based system.  \n \n2. Purpose and Scope  \n2.1. These guidelines aim to provide a framework to the State Health Agencies (SHA) under which \nthe empanelment of healthcare service providers may be undertaken. It establishes the \nprocesses that may be undertaken by the SHA to empanel a health care service provider and to \nundertake any disciplinary proceedings/ de- empanelment of health care service providers \nwherever needed. The states have the flexibility to adapt these guidelines based on local \ncontextual variations and state laws, as applicable.   \n"}
{"page": 7, "text": " \n  \nPage 7 of 62 \n2.2.With the objective of providing quality services to its beneficiaries and increase empanelment \nof healthcare providers across the country, the guidelines on empanelment have been \nstrengthened based on three years of experience of implementing the scheme and basis the \nfeedback provided by various stakeholders.   \n \n3. Empanelment of Healthcare Providers- Approach & Criteria \n3.1.Approach for Empanelment \n3.1.1. All States/Union Territories can empanel healthcare providers only in their own State/UT.  \n3.1.2. To improve access and increase utilization of services, if SHA determines the need to \nempanel healthcare service providers outside one’s own state, SHA can approach NHA with \nthe specific request with rationale for the same. NHA will review the request with the \nhospital state1, and after ascertaining need may request the hospital state to empanel the \nhospital. If the hospital state is a non-PM-JAY implementing state, NHA shall prefer to direct \nempanel the healthcare provider or may designate specific SHAs for empanelment of health \ncare service providers accordingly.   \n3.1.3. Any public healthcare facility with the capacity to provide services covered under PM-JAY \ncan be empaneled. If the facility is below CHC level, it must raise pre-authorizations within 6 \nmonths of empanelment otherwise they will be moved to invalid public hospital bucket in \nconsultation with respective SHAs. After being moved to invalid public hospital bucket, the \nfacility can again be moved to approved for empanelment bucket on discretion of SHA. \n3.1.4. SHA must ensure empanelment of all public facilities (along with any in-patient or day care \nservices outsourced by the public healthcare facility) providing inpatient services or those \ncovering daycare packages covered under AB PM-JAY.  \n \n1 State where the hospital is situated.  \n"}
{"page": 8, "text": " \n  \nPage 8 of 62 \n3.1.5. Public Hospitals under other schemes/ government bodies including Employee State \nInsurance Corporation (ESIC)and CGHS hospitals are eligible for empanelment under the \nscheme, if they meet the minimum eligible requirement under PM-JAY. These hospitals will \nhave to fill in the application on the web portal. \n3.1.6. All healthcare service providers empaneled under the scheme including the public hospitals \nwhich are deemed empaneled must mandatorily adhere to the registration process on the \nweb portal.  \n3.1.7. Private hospitals are encouraged to provide ROHINI ID provided by Insurance Information \nBureau (IIB) and public hospitals are encouraged to have National Identification Number \n(NIN) provided by MoHFW. \n3.1.8. Healthcare service providers are encouraged to attain quality milestones by attaining PM-\nJAY Certification i.e., Bronze, Silver and Gold. These quality certifications would also provide \nincentive in terms of higher price for health benefit packages to the healthcare service \nproviders under the scheme.  \n3.1.9. For the healthcare service providers which were empanelled based on Quality \nCertification/accreditation, health care service providers will undergo a renewal process, \nonce every 3 years or till the expiry of validity of PM-JAY Bronze/NABH certification \nwhichever is earlier; to determine compliance to minimum standards. \n3.1.10. National Health Authority may revise the empanelment criteria from time to time during the \nscheme if required. States/UTs will have to undertake any required re-assessments for the \nsame within a stipulated timeline.  \n3.2.Criteria for Empanelment \n3.2.1. For empanelment under the scheme, health care providers should meet the basic minimum \neligibility requirements as detailed in Annexure 1. As these are minimum standards, no \nexceptions can be provided on these.  \n"}
{"page": 9, "text": " \n  \nPage 9 of 62 \n3.2.2. Additionally, specialty specific eligibility criteria have been defined for healthcare providers \noffering specific specialties, e.g., Oncology, Neurology etc. This is applicable over and above \nthe basic minimum criteria and is also detailed in Annexure 1.  \n3.2.3. State Governments will have the flexibility to revise/relax the empanelment criteria (barring \nthe minimum requirements as highlighted in Annex 1), based on their local context, \navailability of providers, and the need to balance quality and access, with prior approval from \nNational Health Authority. The same will have to be incorporated in the web-portal for online \nempanelment of healthcare providers. \n3.3.Incentive Structure for Empanelment \n3.3.1. For all healthcare providers empaneled under the scheme, the additional incentives will be \nprovided on the base health benefits packages as per HBP user guidelines as published on AB PM-\nJAY website. \n4. Institutional Set up for Empanelment \n4.1.Role of NHA \n4.1.1. As a national level body, NHA will continue to support the SHAs in the empanelment process \nby developing guidelines for establishing systems and processes, ensuring the quality of \nservices and maximum empanelment of healthcare service providers.  \n4.1.2. NHA also understands the need to focus on the local context at the state level and provides \nthe necessary flexibility to the states and adapt and adopt the guidelines. \n4.1.3. NHA will be responsible for direct empanelment of healthcare providers in the following \nconditions:  \n• \nNon-PMJAY implementation State: NHA may choose to empanel the \nhealthcare providers itself. \n"}

NHA will also ensure efficiency in the empanelment process by introducing technological \ninterventions for ease of business from time to time.  \n \n4.2.Role of SHA \n4.2.1. Awareness generation among the healthcare service providers: SHA will be responsible for \ncreating awareness among the healthcare service providers about the scheme and ensuring \nmaximum eligible healthcare providers participate in the scheme. SHA may conduct IEC \ncampaigns or sensitisation workshops at district, sub-district, Taluka/block level to discuss \nthe details of the scheme including the contours of the scheme, the empanelment criteria, \nbenefit packages, process of empanelment and claims settlement etc. with the healthcare \nproviders and address any query that they may have about the scheme. Representatives of \nboth public and private healthcare providers (both managerial and operational persons) \nincluding officials from Insurance Company may be invited to participate in the workshop. \n4.2.2. Verification and approval of the applications: SHA will play a key role in the approval flow \nfor the submitted applications. The final decision to approve/reject the application of the \nhealthcare service provider will rest with SHA. The decision on relaxation to be given to any \nhealthcare service provider based on the recommendation of the district empanelment \ncommittee (DEC) will also rest with SHA.  Additionally, SHA will be responsible for providing \nsupportive supervision to DEC and ensuring timebound empanelment process throughout \nits lifecycle.   \n \n2 National Health Care Providers are those hospitals /medical colleges which are under the ambit of MoHFW, \nGoI and are directly empaneled by NHA under the PM-JAY scheme.  \n"}
{"page": 11, "text": " \n  \nPage 11 of 62 \n4.2.3. Analysis of the Healthcare Service Provider Landscape: To ensure equity and access to the \nbeneficiaries, SHA will be responsible for conducting district level analysis of the empaneled \nhealthcare service providers to understand the current landscape and plan for the \nempanelment for the future. Some of the indicators that may be considered are as follows:  \n- Hospital to population ratio \n- Beds to population ratio \n- Doctors to population ratio \n- Percentage of active empaneled hospitals  \n- Specialties in various districts \n- Geographic distribution of empaneled hospitals  \n- Percentage of available eligible hospitals in the district empaneled  \n \n4.3.Institutional Structures at State \n4.3.1. State Empanelment Committee (SEC)-Structure and Role  \n4.3.1.1.The State Empanelment Committee or the SEC will be established at the state level to monitor the \noverall empanelment process and undertake disciplinary proceedings against errant health service \nproviders in the state. The role of the SEC would be to supervise the work of DEC and to ensure \ntimely empanelment of healthcare service providers, as well as handle matters pertaining to \nrejection or pendency of hospital applications at the SHA level.   \n4.3.1.2. The recommended composition of SEC is as follows:  \n- CEO, SHA \n- Medical Officer - not less than Director level officer, preferably Director In-Charge for \nimplementation of Clinical Establishment Regulation Act- Member \n- Two State Government officials nominated by the Health Department-Members \n- In case of Insurance model, nominated Insurance company representative at least \nAdditional General Manager or equivalent. \n"}

District Empanelment Committee (DEC) -Structure and Role \n4.3.2.1.It is prescribed that a District Empanelment Committee (DEC) be formed at the district level \nwhich will assist SEC/SHA in the empanelment process and disciplinary proceedings for \nhealthcare providers at the district level. It will be responsible for conducting the following:  \n- Validation and scrutiny of the uploaded documents by the hospital for completeness and \naccuracy \n- Conducting field and desktop-based verification of hospitals both during empanelment \nand in case of any complaints related to infrastructure  \n- Submission of the verification reports to the SHA through the online empanelment portal \nwith a recommended decision to approve or reject with clear reasons for rejection \n- Recommending any relaxation in empanelment criteria, if needed (with justification for \nrelaxation). \n4.3.2.2.Recommended structure of DEC is as follows:  \n- Chief Medical Officer of the district \n- District Program Manager/ District Program Coordinator -SHA \n- In case of Insurance model, Insurance company representative \n- SHA may require the Insurance Company to provide a medical representative to \nassist the DEC in its activities. \n"}
{"page": 13, "text": " \n  \nPage 13 of 62 \n4.3.3. Third Party Empanelment Agency (TPEA) -Structure and Role  \n4.3.3.1. If additional support is required for the empanelment process, SHA may hire a third-party \nempanelment agency. The TPEA will be responsible to facilitate verification of healthcare \nproviders (both physical as well desk-top verification). It is recommended that those states \nwith large network of service providers may avail this option. The composition and \nqualifications of TPEA will be similar as DEC. However, the following must be ensured while \nhiring TPEA:  \n- The third-party agency hired should not be the current implementation support agency (ISA) \nof the State. \n- A pre-defined cooling off period should be applicable for any agency that was historically \nengaged by the state as ISA before it can apply for TPEA.   \n- Third party to ensure physical verification of healthcare service provider is conducted along \nwith DEC/district nodal officer within 1 months of empanelment first approved. \n- SHA (directly or through DEC) will conduct a sample physical audit of 10% of the facilities \nthat were verified by the TPEA within a period of 3 months and 10% audit of rejected \nfacilities. If discrepancies are observed during physical audit by SHA, stipulated penalties \nshall be levied. \n- The state wise recommendation for hiring of TPEA or additional resource as deputed by SHA \nis as follows: \nStates \nRecommended for Third party Empanelment \nAgency/ Additional resource as deputed \nby SHA level \nGujarat \nThird Party Empanelment Agency  \nUttar Pradesh \nThird Party Empanelment Agency \nHaryana \nThird Party Empanelment Agency \n"}

A login account for a nodal officer from DEC \nwill be created by SHA as a one-time process. This login ID will be used to download the \napplication of healthcare providers and upload the inspection report. \n5.2.1.2.2. As a first step, the documents uploaded by the hospital will be verified by DEC for \ncompleteness. In case any documents are found wanting, the DEC may return the \napplication to the hospital for rectifying any errors in the documents. \n5.2.1.2.3. After desktop verification, DEC/district nodal officer will physically inspect the premises \nof the hospital and verify the accuracy of the details entered in the empanelment \napplication, including but not limited to equipment, human resources, service, and \nquality standards. Post the physical verification, it will submit its report as per the format \ngiven in the HEM portal along with supporting pictures/videos/document scans. The \nteam will also verify that the healthcare providers have applied for empanelment for all \nspecialties as available in the hospital. In case it is found that hospital has not applied for \none or more specialties, the hospital will be instructed to apply for the missing specialties \nwithin a stipulated a timeline (i.e., 15 working days from the inspection date).

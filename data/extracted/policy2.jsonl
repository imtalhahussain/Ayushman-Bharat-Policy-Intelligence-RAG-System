{"page": 7, "text": "1\n1\nIntroduction to PM Ayushman Bharat Health \nInfrastructure Mission\n1.1\t BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n\t\n1.1.1.\t The COVID 19 pandemic has highlighted the fact that essential public health functions \nnecessary to respond to such an outbreak were weak. Limited laboratory capacity at \nall levels meant that functions of testing, case detection, surveillance and outbreak \nmanagement were challenging and facilities for critical care provision lacked adequate \nIntensive Care Units, Isolation Beds, Oxygen supply, and Ventilators. COVID 19 also \nillustrated that despite using the health systems approach to horizontal integration \nbetween programmes, much more needs to be done to strengthen convergence between \ninstitutions created for vertical disease control programmes and the district and sub district \nservice delivery systems.\n\t\n1.1.2.\t In the early months of the pandemic, particularly in states with weak health systems there \nwas a significant decline in the delivery of non-COVID essential services, on account of \nmarshalling of all resources for COVID related activities. Health systems across the country \nwere hard put to manage the delivery of both sets of services, viz. the COVID and non-\nCOVID essential health services.\n\t\n1.1.3.\t Public health has significant externalities (food and drug regulation/, public health action, \nincluding health promotion and prevention and surveillance for infectious disease) which \nrequire government intervention. Persistent inequities in access and coverage are a barrier \nto India’s progress in health indicators and markets do not address inequities in health care.\n\t\n1.1.4.\t The on-going COVID 19 pandemic has demonstrated that India’s health systems need to \nbe better equipped to address public health needs across primary, secondary, and tertiary \ncare levels. India’s current epidemiological and demographic status, with the rapid rise \nin non- communicable diseases, a double burden of chronic and infectious diseases, and \nunfinished agenda of reproductive, maternal new-born and child health services has created \nan increasing demand on health care and public health services.\n\t\n1.1.5.\t At the same time, high costs of care, persistent health inequalities, and reduced access to \nessential public health services particularly for those living in remote areas and in slum and \nslum like areas, challenge our health system. COVID 19 and predecessor Infectious diseases \nsuch as SARS, H1N1, NIPAH and Zika outbreaks have highlighted that the health systems \nneeds to fully prepare and gear up to respond to public health emergencies.\n"}
{"page": 8, "text": "2\nOperational Guidelines for PM Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission\n\t\n1.1.6.\t 27.5% of all deaths in India in 2016 were due to communicable diseases, maternal, neonatal \nand nutritional disorders while non-communicable diseases and injuries accounted for \n61.8% and 10.7% deaths respectively. Communicable diseases also contribute to 32.7% of \nDALYs in India (Source: India: Health of the Nation’s States, ICMR) whereas injuries contribute \nto 11.9% of DALYs in India, and 10.7% of deaths in India. It is anticipated that about 3-5% of \nemergencies would require ICU facilities and oxygen supported beds for critical care. There is \nan urgent need to strengthen these facilities and create additional amenities (infrastructure, \nequipment etc.) including for dialysis, in existing district hospitals to meet such unforeseen \nepidemics, disasters etc. \n\t\n1.1.7\t The present architecture of the public hospitals is not equipped fully to handle the critical \nrequirement of clinical management of affected patients while maintaining essential \nservices during periods of public health challenges posed by pandemics such as the current \nCOVID-19 pandemic. Many of the hospital buildings currently available do not have the \nprovision for segregating a part of the building as an infectious diseases treatment block\\\nwing. As a result, in order to avoid mixing of COVID and non-COVID patients, at many places \nfull hospitals were required to be designated as COVID Dedicated Facilities. Apart from \nthat, at many district headquarters, especially in districts with largely rural settings, district \nhospital is the only hospital available where critical care services can be provided to people. \nAs a result, either large amounts of expenses are necessitated on account of transportation \nof patients to other districts or in case the only available hospital is designated as the COVID \n(pandemic) dedicated hospitals, there is a severe adverse impact on the other essential \nservices such as institutional deliveries, blood transfusion services, dialysis and chemotherapy \netc. Strengthening all the districts with Critical Care Hospital Blocks of 50-100 beds as per \nthe population size, will enable the public healthcare system at the district level to respond \nadequately during the public health challenges posed by future pandemics and in periods \nof epidemic outbreaks and enable the health systems to also maintain the essential health \nservices in such times. In other times when there is no epidemic, these blocks will continue \nto provide health services, especially for critical care.\n\t\n1.1.8.\t The disease burden in the country also demonstrates the need for provision of high \nquality laboratory services at district and block levels. Delays in diagnosis compromise \nearly detection and initiation of appropriate treatment. In the case of infectious disease \noutbreaks, such delays can lead to widespread community transmission.\n\t\n1.1.9.\t Both general and out of hours laboratory services (e.g. emergency services, critical care \nservices) are being provided through laboratories that are largely fragmented. Also, public \nhealth surveillance for abnormal morbidity/mortality, reporting of human or animal disease \npatterns and testing of samples etc. for public health needs remains a weak area in most \ndistricts.\n\t\n1.1.10.\t The present public healthcare system structure at the Block level is not equipped to handle \npublic health emergencies and also to respond and monitor the healthcare services. Every \nBlock in the Country is envisaged to have a Community Health Centre (CHC) at the Block \nheadquarter and serve as a hub for referral from the Sub-Health Centres (SHCs) and Primary \nHealth Centres (PHCs) within the block. However, the status of availability of CHCs across \n"}
{"page": 9, "text": "3\nOperational Guidelines for PM Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission\nstates is highly variable, with the block level CHC in some states in effect being just another \nPHC. In some other states, the block CHC, on the other hand, is also a First Referral Unit. The \nfunctions of a Block CHC are mostly focused on clinical services that too largely RMNCH+A \nand selected infectious diseases. The outbreak of COVID-19 has highlighted a constrained \npublic health response as a result of a suboptimal public health focus at the block level.      \n\t\n1.1.11.\t The COVID-19 pandemic has also highlighted the various challenges faced in provisioning \nof trained human resources. Experience suggests that as the pandemic evolves and as the \nexperts gain a better understanding of the epidemiology and virulence of the disease, \nthe training needs also evolve. With a pandemic like COVID-19 which is a new infection, \nexperimentation in arriving at the best treatment protocol also leads to changing training \nneeds. The Ministry has set up the iGOT training platform for online training of healthcare \nprofessionals. More importantly over a period of last 5 months, the Central Institutions of \nExcellence such as the AIIMS Delhi, PGI Chandigarh etc. have assumed the much needed \nmentorship role for building confidence of the healthcare professional providing treatment \nservices to the patients, be it about personal protection, infection prevention, plasma \ntherapy, patient monitoring or about the best possible line to treatment. These institutions \nhave also acted as training sites (albeit the trainings being largely offsite!!) for the healthcare \nprofessional and for undertaking clinical studies to inform further policy direction. This \nMinistry has set up INIs like AIIMS Delhi and several other large hospitals cum teaching \ninstitutes such as Safdarjung and RML Hospital. Also, 22 new AIIMS are being established \nunder the Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY). These are tertiary healthcare, \nmedical education and research institutes. In addition, the Ministry of HRD also operates 2 \nadvanced medical education and tertiary healthcare institutes/ hospitals. However, these \nhospitals have not been designed to deal with infectious disease patients. Infectious disease \nhospitals are specially designed, with negative pressure systems and other special features \nto control spread of the infectious disease. \n\t\n1.1.12.\t The complexity of COVID-19 pandemic, which has spread to over 150 Countries in the \nWorld, has highlighted the need of having competent core capacities for surveillance and \nresponse, diagnostic labs, logistics (including PPEs, Masks, Sanitizers and Disinfectants) and \nappropriate quarantine and isolation facilities at various levels. During the course of past 3-4 \nmonths, the Country has faced numerous challenges like quarantine of evacuees (for China, \nIran, Italy), widespread migration, containment of complex clusters and development of \ndiagnostic capacities across the Country.\n\t\n1.1.13.\t The 40 metro cities (including Tier I and Tier II cities) presently do not have any infrastructure \nfor regular surveillance for community based health measures and health facilities. \nSimilarly, implementation of the Integrated Health Information Platform (IHIP), an IT \nenabled comprehensive surveillance platform has also only been implemented in 7 states. \nCapacities for timely data collection, collation and analytics also need strengthening. \nThe Epidemiological Intelligence Service, housed in the NCDC has been instrumental in \ncontaining recent out breaks of Nipah in Kerala and Zika in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. \nHowever, the EIS too needs to be strengthened to have the capacity to effectively lead the \ntechnical response to pandemics of the magnitude of COVID-19.\n"}
{"page": 10, "text": "4\nOperational Guidelines for PM Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission\n\t\n1.1.14.\t There is a need for an integrated surveillance program at all levels (Zonal and State \nlevels) and also its expansion to various metro cities. It is also envisaged that the IT level \nsurveillance network is developed, so that that there is uninterrupted data flow particularly \nsites of screening to tracking in the community and further linking it up with diagnostic \nlaboratories and isolation hospitals. The proposal encompasses strengthening of all Divisions \nof NCDC focused on applied public health and epidemiological intelligence, building \ncapacity for emerging and re-emerging infections, surveillance and its evaluation, National \nprogram for anti-microbial resistance (AMR) containment under the One health approach, \nbiosafety-biosecurity, occupational safety & climate change, and building of competencies \namong front line health care workers for strengthening community surveillance at National, \nRegional and District levels.\n\t\n1.1.15.\t A major impediment for quick response mechanism is non-availability of dedicated \nsecondary/ tertiary level medical facilities near the disaster site due to damage to the \nhealth facilities. In major public health emergencies such as COVID-19, the health system \ngets overwhelmed and there is need to deploy field hospitals. With increasing frequency of \nnatural and man-made disasters, incl. complex emergencies, a pressing need has been felt \nfor development of quick response medical clinical teams. Keeping this in mind, WHO under \nits “Global EMT (Emergency Medical Team) Initiative” calls for quality assured, accredited, \nself-sufficient in every aspect wherein, member countries deploy medical teams in another \nmember country during times of disasters, natural calamities as per the need of the host \ncountry. This also gives an opportunity for countries providing EMTs not only to strengthen \nits system to global standards but also deploy these teams for internal requirements. It is \nenvisaged to develop these capacities through the Health Emergency Operation Centres \n(HEOCs) and the self-contained container based mobile hospitals.\n\t\n1.1.16.\t Emerging infections continue to disrupt the health care system and are becoming \nincreasingly complicated to detect and treat successfully. The public health system is \ncontinually reminded of the challenges posed by the unexpected, whether it is the pandemic \nor a bioterrorist act. Thus, there is increasing need to strengthen the infrastructure for \ncreating favourable environment for epidemiological studies on virus outbreak and other \npathogens related to public health importance.\n\t\n1.1.17.\t There is need for setting up institutions which can serve to advance an evolving science of \ndisease elimination to design and develop theoretical, quantitative, qualitative, behavioural \nand applied research practice in order to better translate evidences to policy in partnership \nwith other research institutes, national programs and international organizations towards \nmaking time bound promise of communicable disease elimination a reality.\n\t\n1.1.18.\t Emergence of highly infectious and pathogenic viral infections cause significant burden \non public health system. It becomes difficult controlling such diseases, which are highly \ninfectious and pathogenic in nature and have zoonotic origin or spread by aerosols or \nvectors. Recently, our country has witnessed recent emergence of infections like Ebola, \nH5N1, CCHF, KFD, Nipah, H7N9, and MARS CoV, SARS CoV 1 & 2. This has shown countrywide \nneed of enhancing laboratory capacity, networking of institutions dealing with emerging \n"}

Without additional funding, the health system will not only fail to respond to \noutbreaks/disasters and other emergencies but also be ineffective in delivering other \nessential services, delaying and disrupting the country’s progress towards the achievements \nof the goals and targets of the National Health Policy 2017 (NHP, 2017) and the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals.

The Ayushman Bharat – Health and Wellness Centres (AB-HWCs), the \nflagship programme of the Government, will enable attention to community and system \nlevel primary health care interventions for preventive, promotive, curative, rehabilitative \nand palliative care.  The provision of free medicines, diagnostics and access to telemedicine \nservices closer to community is expected to expand coverage and quality of primary health \ncare and reduce patient hardship and improve quality of care. Effective primary health care \ndelivery also includes undertaking public health functions through community and facility \nlevel action for surveillance, screening and early detection, vector control, etc. \n\t\n3.1.2\t AB-HWCs offer the opportunity to ensure that girls and women would have access to care not \njust for reproductive health services, but also for the newer elements of the Comprehensive \nPrimary Health Care package including screening, diagnosis, and treatment for hypertension, \ndiabetes and mental health. Since services are provided close to community, access to \nessential services would be sustained for such sub population groups. Teleconsultation \nservices are of particular importance in reducing access barriers for women and will ensure \ngender equity. These centres will not only provide primary level clinical care services for an \nexpanded range of services as per Operational guidelines of Comprehensive Primary Health \nCare and subsequent Operational Guidelines on the expanded range of services at the centre \nbut also ensure outreach services are provided to their catchment population. \n\t\n3.1.3\t Under the AB-HWCs programme, it is envisaged that 1,50,000 AB-HWCs shall be set up \nin the country by December 2022.  Out of these, 12,500 HWCs are being setup by the \nMinistry of AYUSH as AYUSH-HWCs. As per Rural Health Statistics, 2020, as on 31st March \n2020, there are 47,518 Sub Health Centres, which are functioning in rented buildings / \npanchayat or voluntary society buildings and these SHCs require building to be constructed. \nThese infrastructure gaps of SHCs are significant especially in 7 High Focus States and \n"}

Support is \nprovided to the States to have Urban PHCs @50,000 per population. Outreach functions in \nthis population, are undertaken by five ANMs and 20-25 ASHAs, with a normative coverage \nof a population of 10,000 served by a team of one ANM and five ASHAs. Under Ayushman \nBharat, Urban PHCs are being strengthened as Health and Wellness Centres (UPHC-HWCs) \nto deliver Comprehensive Primary Health Care (CPHC).  \n\t\n4.1.2\t Healthcare needs and aspirations of urban residents are different from those in rural areas. \nThe current strategy of relying on outreach teams of ANM and ASHA alone to provide \nselective services is not sufficient. State experiences demonstrate that provision of health \ncare services by trained service providers from facilities closer to poorer, and vulnerable \nurban communities is likely to improve access to an expanded range of services, reduce \nOOPE, improve disease surveillance, and strengthen referral linkages. At the same time, \nstate experiences also show that the establishment of “poly clinics / provision of specialist \nservices” in selected Urban PHCs, enables reach of specialist services to poor communities, \nthus building trust in the public health system. \n\t\n4.1.3\t Lack of a frontline health workforce in our cities has emerged as one of the biggest limiting \nfactors in our response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, a paradigm shift is envisaged \nin delivery of urban primary healthcare based on the learnings from the management \nof COVID-19 pandemic which has affected urban areas disproportionately, especially \nin metropolitan areas such as Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, \nAhmedabad, Surat etc. A significant proportion of the urban population also constitutes \nof the migrants from other states. Also, a large proportion of these are usually settled in \ncongested urban settings. Expansion and strengthening of the grass-root primary healthcare \ndelivery institutions has thus emerged as a pressing need in the changed context. Limited \ncapacities of health systems in urban areas and the disruption in non-COVID essential health \nservices also underlines the need for provision of Universal and CPHC capacities in urban \nareas. \n"}

In some other states, on the other hand, the Block CHC also \nserves as a First Referral Unit (FRU).  \n\t\n5.1.2\t The present public healthcare system structure at the Block level is not equipped to handle \npublic health emergencies and also to respond and monitor the healthcare services. \nCurrently, the functions of a Block CHC are mostly focused on clinical services that too largely \nRMNCH+A and selected infectious diseases. The outbreak of COVID-19 has highlighted a \nconstrained public health response as a result of a suboptimal public health focus at the \nblock level.\n\t\n5.1.3\t Block Public Health Units are proposed in all the 3382 blocks in 8 High Focus States and 3 Hill states \n(Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, UT-Jammu and Kashmir, Jharkhand, Madhya \nPradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand).

The goal of the Block Public Health Unit is to \nprotect and improve the health of the population in the block.  Decentralization at this \nlevel would enable a focus on reaching remote areas and unreached populations.  It is \nenvisaged that the Block Headquarter level facility (variously referred to as Community \nHealth Centres (CHCs)/ Sub- Divisional Hospitals (SDHs)/Block Primary Health Centres \n(PHCs), (the nomenclature may vary across states) would be strengthened to become a Block \nPublic Health Unit.

Delays in diagnosis and reporting compromise \nearly detection and delay initiation of appropriate treatment and the necessary public \nhealth action for controlling the spread of disease.  Although, both general and out of \nhours laboratory services (e.g. emergency services, critical care services) are currently being \nprovided through laboratories, the capacities for public health surveillance for abnormal \nmorbidity/mortality, reporting of human or animal disease patterns and testing of samples \netc. for public health needs remain limited in most districts. \n\t\n6.1.2\t Improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the laboratory services to support \nprogrammatic scale-up, requires Integrated District Laboratory systems. This will optimise \naccess to laboratory services, quality assurance efforts, cost-effectiveness, and efficient use \nof human resources. To address these gaps, an Integrated Public Health Laboratories in all \n730 districts will be set-up under the scheme. An integrated model for the laboratory is \ncrucial to increase efficiency, avoid duplication of laboratory resources, improve patient \nservices, channelize resources for development of capacity for multi-disease testing and \nto equip the laboratory in terms of better preparedness and response to emerging disease \nthreats. \n\t\n6.1.3\t The District Integrated Public Health Laboratory unit would also serve as the apex of a \nnetwork to link labs with block, state and regional public health and veterinary labs to support \nmulti-sectoral collaboration for clinical management and public health surveillance. \nIntegrated Public Health laboratories will establish multi-level linkages from blocks to \ndistricts, to state and finally to zonal/regional and National level laboratories for providing a \ncomprehensive set of laboratory services which can also aid in timely prediction of outbreak \nand supporting policy decisions. IPHLs at the District level will mentor and handhold BPH \nLabs of the BPHUs and ensure regular training and capacity building of the staff. To allow \nIPHL seamlessly blend into the existing laboratory services network, interconnected and \nfunctional linkages both upwards and downwards are envisaged.

{"page": 50, "text": "44\n17\nCritical Care Hospital Blocks\n\t7.1\t BACKGROUND\n\t\n7.1.1\t The COVID pandemic has highlighted the need for critical care facilities, especially at \nthe level of the districts. The country’s increasing disease burden particularly related to \nthe sequelae of chronic communicable and non-communicable diseases and injury also \nrequires access to critical care. Non-communicable diseases and injuries account for 61.8% \nand 10.7% deaths respectively. (Source: India: Health of the Nation’s States, ICMR). \n\t\n7.1.2\t Average medical expenditure per hospitalization (both rural and urban, private and \npublic combined) is Rs. 20135/- (as per NSSO 2017-18). It is anticipated that about 3-5% of \nemergencies would require ICU facilities and oxygen supported beds for critical care.   There is \nan urgent need to strengthen these facilities and create additional amenities (infrastructure, \nequipment etc.), in existing district hospitals to meet such unforeseen epidemics, disasters \netc.   \n\t\n7.1.3\t The current architecture of the public hospitals is not equipped fully to handle the dual \nburden of meeting critical care needs and maintaining essential services as was seen during \nthe two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many hospital buildings especially in districts, do \nnot have provision for segregating a part of the building as an infectious disease treatment \nblock/wing.  As a result, in order to avoid mixing of COVID and non-COVID patients, entire \nhospitals were required to be designated as COVID Dedicated Facilities, thereby resulting \nin inability to provide non COVID essential services such as institutional deliveries, blood \ntransfusion services, dialysis and chemotherapy etc.    \n\t\n7.1.4\t Under PM Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission , Government of India would \nsupport 100 and 50-bedded Hospital Blocks/ Wings to augment the capacity of public health \nfacilities to provide assured critical care.

The priority is to ensure that there is one Urban-HWC per 15,000-\n20,000 population catering predominantly to poor and vulnerable populations, \nresident in slum and slum-like areas. The norms are relaxable as per the local \ncontext of the States.  Decisions regarding the required number of Urban-HWCs, \nwould depend on population density, presence of slums & similar habitations, \nvulnerable population, peri-urban areas and newly Notified Urban Areas.\n"}
